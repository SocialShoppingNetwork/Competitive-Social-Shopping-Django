            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the launch of its first watch in 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. Armed with cutting-edge technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered the field confident it could develop timepieces that would push watch technology forward.\r\n\r\nCasio\u2019s G-Shock line was created on just such a directive: to build a watch that never breaks. And in 1983, this product was developed to shatter the notion that a watch is simply a fragile piece of jewelry that needs to be handled with care.\r\n\r\nG-Shock is renowned as the world\u2019s toughest watch and is in the midst of a huge renaissance since its 25th anniversary celebration last year. It is the best trending watch brand in the industry right now and thanks to its toughness and durability as well as it\u2019s cutting-edge technology, it is among the best values in not only timekeeping but all personal accessories.\r\n\r\nIn addition to toughness, 200 meter resistance and fantastic cutting edge and hip styling some G-shocks also have such technology as Tough Solar Power for battery life of 20-30 years (great for our planet), Atomic timekeeping for the more precise time available on earth as well as unique features like moon phase and tide graphs. \r\n\r\nG-Shocks come in a variety of styles including Rubber/Resin bands, Solid Stainless Steel and even Titanium. \r\n\r\nSince it\u2019s launch, Casio\u2019s G-Shock continues to evolve and push the envelope. The non-stop, self-adjusting (solar-powered atomic-timekeeping) G-Shocks featured in the Amazon.com assortment are the latest, greatest example of this evolution! \r\n\r\nThe Casio Story\r\n\r\nIn developing its own wristwatches Casio began with the basic question, \"What is a wristwatch?\" Rather than simply making a digital version of the conventional mechanical watch, we thought that the ideal wristwatch should be something that shows all facets of time in a consistent way. Based on this, Casio was able to create a watch that displayed the precise time including the second, minute, hour, day, and month \u2014 not to mention a.m. or p.m., and the day of the week. It was the first watch in the world with a digital automatic calendar function that eliminated the need to reset the calendar due the variation in month length. Rather than using a conventional watch face and hands, a digital liquid crystal display was adopted to better show all the information. This culminated in the 1974 launch of the CASIOTRON, the world\u2019s first digital watch with automatic calendar. The CASIOTRON won acclaim as a groundbreaking product that represented a complete departure from the conventional wristwatch.\r\n\r\nCasio transformed the concept of the watch \u2014 from a mere timepiece to an information device for the wrist \u2014 and undertook product planning based on this innovative idea. We developed not only time functions such as global time zone watches, but also other radical new functions using Casio\u2019s own digital technology, including calculator and dictionary functions, as well as a phonebook feature based on memory technology, and even a thermometer function using a built-in sensor. The memory-function watches became our DATA BANK product series, while the sensor watches developed into two unique Casio product lines of today: the Pathfinder series displaying altitude, atmospheric pressure, and compass readings.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Casio launched the shock-resistant G-Shock watch. This product shattered the notion that a watch is a fragile piece of jewelry that needs to be handled with care, and was the result of Casio engineers taking on the challenge of creating the world\u2019s toughest watch. Using a triple-protection design for the parts, module, and case, the G-Shock offered a radical new type of watch that was unaffected by strong impacts or shaking. Its practicality was immediately recognized, and its unique look, which embodied its functionality, became wildly popular, resulting in explosive sales in the early 1990s. The G-Shock soon adopted various new sensors, solar-powered radio-controlled technology (described below), and new materials for even better durability. By always employing the latest technology, and continuing to transcend conventional thinking about the watch, the G-Shock brand has become Casio\u2019s flagship timepiece product.\r\n\r\nToday, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, and the radio-controlled function means users never have to reset the time. In particular, the radio-controlled function represents a revolution in time-keeping technology similar to the impact created when mechanical watches gave way to quartz technology. Through the further development of high radio-wave sensitivity, miniaturization, and improved energy efficiency, Casio continues to produce a whole range of radio-controlled models."

It also includes HP's 3D DriveGuard, which \r\nsends a signal to shut down the hard drive upon sudden movement or shock by \r\nusing a three-axis digital accelerometer chip. </font>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<font size=\"3\">Memory: The 1 GB of installed RAM (1 x 1024 MB, PC2-5300) offers \r\na top-of-class 667 MHz speed. This notebook has a maximum capacity of 2 GB of \r\nRAM. </font>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<font size=\"3\">DVD/CD Drive: The HP 2133 Mini-Note PC does not include an \r\nintegrated optical drive, but HP offers optional drives that connect to the \r\nMini-Note using the optional HP External MultiBay II. </font>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<i><font size=\"3\">Keyboard &amp; Mouse:</font></i><font size=\"3\"> The \r\nspill-resistant keyboard is 92 percent of full size, 101/102-key compatible with \r\nisolated inverted-T cursor control keys, both left and right control and alt \r\nkeys, 12 function keys, and hotkey combinations for audio volume, power \r\nconservation, brightness, and other features. It also features HP DuraKeys, \r\nwhich have a clear coating applied over the keyboard to protects the finish and \r\nprinted letters and characters. The touchpad includes a scroll zone and two \r\nsoft-touch buttons. </font>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b><font size=\"3\">Screen, Video &amp; Audio</font></b><font size=\"3\"><br>\r\nThe 8.9-inch display has a 1280 x 768-pixel resolution, for native 720p \r\nhigh-resolution clarity, and the Mini-Note includes a VGA output for connecting \r\nto an external monitor or projector. Video is powered by the integrated Via \r\nChrome 9 video/graphics card, and it includes an integrated high-definition \r\naudio card for crisp sound via the internal 2-watt stereo speakers. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b><font size=\"3\">Networking, Connectivity &amp; Expansion</font></b><font size=\"3\"><br>\r\nThis notebook has an integrated tri-mode Intel 3945ABG wireless LAN \r\n(802.11a/b/g), with throughput up to 54 Mbps at 5 GHz (802.11a) and 2.4 GHz \r\n(802.11g). It's compatible with 802.11b/g networks (commonly found in home \r\nrouters and Wi-Fi hotspots) as well as 802.11a networks (which has a higher \r\nthroughput, but more limited range--great for closed office environments). You \r\nalso get super-fast wired connectivity via the Gigabit Ethernet port \r\n(10/100/1000). </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\">The Mini-Note also includes a next-generation ExpressCard \r\n54/34 card slot (replacing the PCMCIA slot), which lets you take advantage of \r\nthinner, faster, and lighter expansion cards for even more advanced wireless, \r\nnetworking, storage, and security features.

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\nEquipped with Dyson Ball technology, this upright vacuum cleaner sits on a ball for easy twisting and turning around furniture and obstacles--no more missed angles or tiresome back-and-forth vacuuming. The ball also encapsulates the machine's 6-1/2 amp motor, creating a low center of gravity for even easier maneuverability. The vacuum cleaner uses Root Cyclone technology to separate dirt from the air by centrifugal force, which ensures efficient cleaning with no clogging or loss of suction. Effective for use on all floor types, the unit's motorized brushbar can be turned on to remove dirt and pet hair from carpets, or turned off to protect delicate rugs and floors. It also supplies a reversible wand for extended reach when cleaning stairs, drapes, upholstery, and more.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor cleaner expelled air, the unit comes with a washable lifetime HEPA filter that traps microscopic allergens such as pollen and bacteria. In fact, the air expelled from a Dyson has up to 150 times less bacteria and mold than the air you breathe, and all Dyson uprights are certified asthma friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The unit's hygienic 1/5-gallon bin quickly empties without ever having to touch the dust--just press the button and dust empties from the bottom; the clear polycarbonate bin also allows for easily viewing the cleaning progress and gauging when it needs to be emptied. Other highlights include fingertip controls, a constant suction power of 115 air watts, a 20-foot cord, a maximum reach of 28-5/7 feet, and a combination accessory tool (nozzle converts to a brush tool for dusting). Even more, its handle collapses for storage in a closet. Weighing just 11-2/3 pounds, the ultra-lightweight and compact vacuum cleaner measures 13-2/3 by 11 by 43-2/7 inches and carries a five-year parts-and-labor warranty.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDyson engineers are continuously challenging existing products and developing new technologies to make them work better. DC24 All floors features Dyson Ball\u2122 technology so the vacuum sits on a ball, allowing you to maneuver around furniture with a turn of the wrist. With patented Root Cyclone\u2122 technology, DC24 All floors doesn\u2019t lose suction as you vacuum. Dyson proves no loss of suction using the IEC 60312 Cl 2.9 test standard. The vacuum has concentrated technology which means it has all the performance of a Dyson upright and is only 2/3 the size. DC24 All floors is ultra-lightweight and compact; it weighs less than 12 lbs and the wand compresses for easy storage. A reversible wand allows you to clean awkward areas with the onboard accessory tool. Parts and labor are guaranteed by Dyson for 5 years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nApartment dwellers, go for the ball!\r\n\r\nWith its convenient, collapsible handle for closet storage, the Dyson DC24 Ball Upright is the lightest and most compact vacuum in Dyson's line-up. This vacuum model is based upon the successful ?Ball? design which allows the head and base off the vacuum to pivot and turn with a twist of the wrist. The design allows the vacuum to easily maneuver around furniture and tight spaces with ease. As such, it is excellent for cleaning all floors with the grace and aplomb of a ballet dancer. It has a lifetime HEPA filter. There are no bags to replace. An extending wand cleans drapes, upholstery, and more.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen and where storage space is prime and closets are already crammed, this 12-pound Dyson offers a collapsible handle. It's an upright that fits into really small spaces. \r\n"

            "description": "The Black & Decker MSW100 ReadyWrench lets you say goodbye to lost or missing sockets for good. This all-in-one wrench puts 16 of the most popular standard and metric socket sizes at your fingertips--just spin either of the tool's two rotating heads to find the right size. With no socket set to store or organize, you'll make short work of general household assembly jobs, regular maintenance tasks, common do-it-yourself repairs, advanced automotive jobs, and more.\r\n\r\nNo More Guesswork, Lost or Missing Sockets\r\nKeeping track of individual sockets from a socket set can be a chore, as sockets often go missing or get dropped and misplaced. Likewise, socket sets can be tipped and scattered on garage floors, and they are usually unorganized, which makes it difficult to find the size you're looking for. Thankfully, the ReadyWrench puts an end to lost sockets and ensures you'll never need to search through a socket set again.\r\n\r\nWhether you're assembling a barbecue, fixing a bike, putting together furniture, or tinkering with your car, the ReadyWrench can help save you both time and stress. Thanks to its easy-to-use design, the ReadyWrench lets you transition easily from task to task without having to hunt around for sockets or additional tools.\r\n\r\nSockets Just Took a New Turn\r\nThe ReadyWrench features two rotating heads that easily adjust and click into place--just spin the heads to find the socket size you're looking for. For further convenience, the heads detent at 45 and 90 degrees, so the ReadyWrench can be used like a ratchet for continuous turning.\r\n\r\nWith its short-pin design, the ReadyWrench replaces both one-and two-inch-deep sockets. It easily slides over nuts tightened down on long bolts where even a two-inch-deep or longer socket will not fit.\r\n\r\nOne Incredible Wrench; 16 Most Popular Sizes\r\nThe ReadyWrench, with its multiple socket options and short-pin design, is a versatile and flexible tool--and a great value over purchasing a socket set. The sockets are cast to fit both standard (SAE) and metric bolts, and they have a special six-point socket design that won't damage bolt heads.\r\n\r\nBest of all, the ReadyWrench offers 16 socket options--5/16 inch, 3/8 inch, 7/16 inch, 1/2 inch, 9/16 inch, 5/8 inch, 11/16 inch, 3/4 inch, 8mm, 10mm, 11mm, 13mm, 14mm, 16mm, 17mm, and 19mm--all the standard and metric sizes you need to handle most any project. Additionally, there are color-coded laser markings on the side of each socket for easy reference (metric = blue; standard = red).\r\n\r\nUser-Friendly Tool Designed to Last a Lifetime\r\nThe ReadyWrench is so easy to use, you won't know how you ever lived without it. To start, socket sizes are etched and baked in color into each socket for easy visibility--not imprinted like standard sockets. For added convenience, a helpful size chart (in both inches and millimeters) on the back of the handle lets you know exactly what size you need for a specific job.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the ReadyWrench boasts a durable rubber grip that provides exceptional comfort for high-torque applications and extends the life of the tool. Built to last, the ReadyWrench is made of durable vanadium steel with a nickel chrome finish.\r\n\r\nThe MSW100 ReadyWrench is backed by a lifetime warranty.\r\n\r\nAbout Black & Decker: A History of Innovation and Invention\r\nAs a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools/accessories, hardware, home improvement products, and technology-based fastening systems, Black & Decker has established a reputation for product innovation, high-quality, durable design, and value. With worldwide recognition, Black & Decker has unsurpassed global distribution of hardware and tools.\r\n\r\nBased in Towson, Maryland, Black & Decker was founded in 1910 by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker. In 1917, the company invented a portable electric drill and quickly received a patent for a pistol grip and trigger switch. In the years that followed, the company's success led to entry into foreign markets, and later, the development and acquisition of individual tool lines, such as DeWalt, Porter-Cable, Delta, and more.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\nAll-in-one socket wrench.\r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\n\r\nAll-in-one socket wrench replaces 1- and 2-inch-deep sockets\r\n\r\n16 of the most popular sockets\r\n\r\nDurable rubber grip provides comfort for high-torque jobs\r\n\r\nMeets or exceeds ASME standards\r\n\r\nLifetime warranty"

            "description": "Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person tactical shooter and the sixth entry in the popular Call of Duty series. True to its name and following the lead of its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlier Call of Duty games. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to the Call of Duty series.\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe storyline of Modern Warfare 2 picks up where the events of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. The ultranationalist Russian leader Zakhaev has been eliminated, but it seems that his lieutenant, Vladimir Makarov, is an even bigger danger. Having made a successful play for power, Intel indicates that he is extending the reach of his influence well beyond the borders of Mother Russia, causing a stir in the international community and prompting the involvement of Task Force 141. Task Force 141 is an elite multinational unit made up of Navy Seals, Delta Force operatives, British SAS and CIA. In the single player campaign you are Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson, with the hero of Call of Duty 4, \"Soap\" MacTavish, promoted to Captain, making an appearance as an NPC (non-player character) and your commanding officer. The elimination of Makarov and his underlings at any cost is your number one priority, regardless where the fight occurs.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nThe latest release in arguably the most successful tactical first-person shooter franchise of all-time, gameplay in Modern Warfare 2 follows the same winning and time-tested structure of earlier games in the series. In the single player campaign players are aided by AI squad members as they take on a series of missions aimed at eliminating Ultranationalist forces. Each mission is built around a particular objective, with players utilizing some level of guidance from NPC characters, including \"Soap\" MacTavish, and aided in navigation by the game's heads up display (HUD). Along the way players will be able to utilize a wide variety of weaponry and and vehicles, as well as be able to customize weapons with gadgets attached to them.\r\n\r\nAlso, just as in previous games in the series, Modern Warfare 2 is heavily focused on multiplayer gameplay. The different multiplayer modes, available both in local play and online, contain plenty of customization options and revolve around different strategies ranging from the every man for himself action of \"Free-for All,\" the classic team-based fun of \"Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of \"Search and Destroy,\" just to name a few. Multiplayer modes also feature the \"Perk\" System that players may be familiar with from earlier in the franchise. Through this system players gain additional abilities, weapons and benefits as they gain experience in combat. This can be done by leveling up, but another important way way is through \"kill streaks,\" the number of enemies eliminated in succession. These are available beginning with three kills and include the ability to call for supply drops, predator missile strikes, helicopter gunships and many more. Players have the ability to customize in advance which perks will be available at each number and can even gauge their progress towards each at the touch of a button. With an eye towards not making the game too hard for new players the game also features help to players experiencing \"death streaks,\" multiple consecutive deaths in multiplayer matches.\r\n\r\nSpecial Ops Co-op Mode\r\nAlong with a single player mode and multiple multiplayer modes, Modern Warfare 2 also features an unique third main play option, Special Ops Mode. Available both online and in local play, Special Ops Mode is designed to provide a distinct time-based play option, featuring special scenarios not found in other modes in the game and lots of enemies to take on. This mode can be played either alone or with a friend, again either locally or online, with local co-op play including split-screen functionality.\r\n\r\nKey Game Features\r\n\r\nChallenging Multiplayer Modes \u2013 Modern Warfare 2 will contain a wealth of multiplayer modes including: the every man for himself action of \"Free-for All,\" the classic team-based fun of \"Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of \"Search and Destroy.\"\r\nImproved AI Enemies \u2013 Improved artificial intelligence now allows enemies to attack from virtually any direction as players respawn into the game adding additional challenges.\r\nAn All-new Call of Duty Adventure - Modern Warfare 2 features an all new Call of Duty storyline revolving around the continuing struggles against the Russian rebel group the Ultranationalists, who have found a new and more dangerous leader.\r\nThe 'Special Ops' Optional Co-op Mode \u2013 \"Special Ops\" Mode allows two players, either alone or with a friend, to engage in unique mission play and features split-screen functionality.\r\nDiverse In-game Environments - Battlegrounds traversed in the game range from the lonely, snow-clad mountains of Kazakhstan, to dark tunnels in the Afghanistan and the crowded slums of Rio.\r\nNonstop Action - Modern Warfare 2 contains no cutscenes, so players are always engaged in the action, no matter where they are in the game.\r\nNew Breach Gameplay Mechanic - Players can now blaze their own paths through the game by \"Breaching\" formerly impregnable obstacles like walls and doors with explosives.\r\nNew Gadgets, Weapons and Weapons System Modern Warfare 2 contains many new and updated weapons, new weapons attachments, as well as a variant of the multiplayer weapons customization system from Call of Duty 4, now available in the single player campaign.\r\nNew Perks and Increased Customization - Multiplayer modes feature new perks for leveling up, and for killstreaks and deathstreaks. Those awarded for streaks can customized in advance according to when they become available.\r\n\r\nProduct Features\r\nPlatform: PLAYSTATION 3 | Edition: Standard\r\nEpic single-player campaign picks up immediately following the thrilling events from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\r\nThe definitive multiplayer experience returns, with a host of new perks and enhancements\r\nNew cooperative SpecOps mode, the perfect combination of Modern Warfare's single player intensity and the addictive replayability of its multiplayer\r\nSpecial Ops Mode allows two players, either alone or with a friend, to engage in unique mission play and features split-screen functionality.\r\nModern Warfare 2 contains new and updated weapons, new weapons attachments, and a variant of the multiplayer weapons customization system from Call of Duty 4, now available in the single player campaign.\r\n\r\nAvailable on both XBOX 360 and PS3.

            "description": "Left 4 Dead 2 is the sequel to the best-selling and critically-acclaimed co-op multiplayer smash from Valve, creators of the Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike game properties. With multiple multiplayer options both on and offline, extensive AI custom functionality, four character options, new melee weapons and more, Left 4 Dead 2 promises to become one of 2009's best games on the Xbox 360 platform and set a new benchmark for co-op centric action games.\r\n\r\nStory\r\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is set at roughly the same time as the original \u2013 just after the outbreak that turned most of the population into various zombie mutants. Players assume the role of four new \"Survivors,\" each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads these \"Survivors\" through the southeastern region of the US - from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nJust as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. As you would expect in a scenario where you are regularly surrounded by masses of the undead, it is very good thing to have plenty of help, as well as weapons at your disposal, and Left 4 Dead 2 has players covered on both accounts. The game features several multiplayer options including 2-8 player online and offline (via system link) support in several modes seen in the first game, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, as well as the new Scavenge Mode. This new multiplayer option tasks players, in the role of survivors to find a limited number of fuel canisters hidden in a level in order to keep their individual generators going, while other players in the role of the infected try to stop them. In addition the game features very strong co-op play support, with 2-player support locally and 2-4 player support online.\r\n\r\nThe game features a wealth of melee weapons and additional items handy for battling enemies up-close and personal. Along with melee weapons seen in the first game, players can look forward to wielding new weapons like axes, chainsaws, frying pans, etc. Firearms are also available, but seeing as zombie fighting usually requires a little elbow grease, melee weapons are the mainstay. In addition, players can carry other useful items, including a variety of throwing weapons and several different kinds of support items, like flashlights to startle enemies and light the way in dark environments and healing items like first aid kit and defibrillator kits.\r\n\r\nCustomize with AI Director 2.0\r\nIntroducing the AI Director 2.0, Left 4 Dead 2's dynamic gameplay is taken to the next level by giving the Director the ability to procedurally change weather effects, world objects, and pathways in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match the players' performance. The result is a unique game session custom fitted to provide a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience each time the game is played.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nQuality Co-op Gameplay - Left 4 Dead 2 features quality next generation co-op action gaming from the makers of Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike.\r\nAI Director 2.0 - Advanced technology dubbed \"The AI Director\" drives Left 4 Dead\u2019s unique gameplay \u2013 customizing enemy population, effects, and music, based upon the players\u2019 performance. Left 4 Dead 2 features \"AI Director 2.0,\" which expands the Director\u2019s ability to customize level layout, world objects, weather, and lighting to reflect different times of day.\r\nNew Melee Weapons \u2013 Put a whole slew of melee weapons including axes, chainsaws, frying pans and baseball bats to use which allow you to get up close with the zombies.\r\nMeet \"The Survivors\" - The game features four different survivors, a new storyline and new dialog.\r\nMore Game - On day one, Left 4 Dead 2 features more co-operative campaigns, more campaigns and maps for the versus game modes than the original Left 4 Dead did, plus support for Survival Mode right out of the box.\r\nXbox LIVE Co-op Support - Along with the usual achievement points, Xbox LIVE stats, rankings, and other support drives collaborative play.\r\n\r\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is available on XBOX 360 and PC.

            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nUpgraded with a faster 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, Apple's innovative Mac mini desktop is a great choice for home computing tasks and creating a digital media hub. It fits everything that makes a Mac a Mac inside an elegant 2-inch-tall, 6.5-inch square--just add your own keyboard, mouse, and display. The Mac mini also includes excellent video processing power from the integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics chip, an ultra-fast FireWire 800 port, and dual video outputs--a Mini DisplayPort and a Mini-DVI port.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside its 2-inch-tall, 6.5-inch-square anodized aluminum enclosure, the Mac mini houses the fast Intel Core 2 Duo processor.\r\n\r\nOfficially, Mac mini is a desktop computer. But because it can go places no other desktop can go, it's been used everywhere from boats to server rooms, as the heart of an entertainment center--and even to power robots. Small, elegant, and unassuming, it has a sleek, anodized aluminum case and clean, white surface.\r\n\r\nContinuing Apple's commitment to the environment, the Mac mini exceeds current Energy Star 5.0 requirements by consuming less than 14 watts when idle 45 percent less power than the previous generation. It's also made from highly recyclable aluminum, uses PVC-free internal components and cables, contains no brominated flame retardants, and even features smaller packaging.\r\n\r\nIt comes pre-loaded with Apple's Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard operating system--an operating system custom-designed for the advanced technology inside--and it also comes with the iLife '09 suite of applications, including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes.\r\n\r\nKey Specifications\r\nFaster 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor helps you breeze through everyday tasks such as emailing, web browsing, and working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in iWork or Microsoft Office for Mac (both sold separately).\r\n320 GB hard drive (5400 RPM)\r\n4 GB installed RAM (1066 MHz DDR3; maximum capacity)\r\nNVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor (with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory) for an outstanding everyday graphics experience\r\n8x slot-loading SuperDrive with double-layer DVD support (DVD\u00b1R DL/DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW)\r\nWi-Fi wireless networking (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible)\r\nGigabit Ethernet wired networking (10/100/1000BASE-T)\r\nBluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones\r\nDual video output options with Mini DisplayPort and Mini-DVI (includes Mini-DVI to DVI Adapter; optional Mini-DVI to VGA Adapter)\r\nBuilt-in mono speaker\r\nCombined optical digital output/headphone output (also includes line-in/microphone jack)\r\nDimensions: 6.5 x 6.5 x 2 inches (WxDxH)\r\nWeight: 2.9 pounds\r\nWhat's in the box\r\nMac mini; Mini-DVI to DVI Adapter; 110W power adapter and power cord; install/restore DVDs; printed and electronic documentation\r\n\r\nLimited Warranty And Service\r\nThe Mac mini comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a one-year limited warranty. Purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan to extend your service and support to three years from your computer's purchase date. Only the AppleCare Protection Plan provides you with direct telephone support from Apple technical experts and the assurance that repairs will be handled by Apple-authorized technicians using genuine Apple parts.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nIntel Core 2 Duo Processor\r\nExperience improved energy efficiency and improved multitasking with the 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which also offers an ultra-fast 1066 MHz front-side bus (FSB) and a large 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system's performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)\r\n\r\nThe hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--conserves even more energy. With a substantial 3 MB of shared L2 cache, data and instructions can be kept close to the two processor cores, greatly increasing performance and allowing the entire system to work more efficiently. And, because the processor cores share the L2 cache, either can use the entire amount if the other happens to be idle.\r\n\r\nGraphics Processor\r\nThe Mac mini features the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics processor for up to five times better graphics performance than its predecessor, and its dual display support can drive two Apple or third-party displays with Mini DisplayPort or DVI connections. The NVIDIA GeForce 9400M shares 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM with main memory. You'll notice the difference when you work with high-resolution photos and high-definition video, where graphics-intensive features in iPhoto and iMovie are smoother. And 3D game play--from Spore to Call of Duty--is faster and more responsive.\r\n\r\nWireless Connectivity\r\nThe built-in 802.11n wireless networking provides up to five times the performance and twice the range of 802.11g, but it's also backward-compatible with 802.11a/b/g routers, enabling you to communicate with the a wide variety of Wi-Fi resources. It works seamlessly with the new AirPort Extreme with 802.11n. Use the built-in Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to your PDA or cell phone, synchronize addresses, or download pictures from your cell phone. You can also use a wireless headset for iChat audio chats and VoIP calls as well as quickly share files with a colleague."

            "description": "Despicable Me is a compelling animated comedy about an aging supervillain's falling popularity at the hands of a younger supervillain and three young orphan girls. Gru is a true, bad-to-the-core evildoer who's earned the title of the world's No. 1 supervillain. But when young upstart Vector steals the Pyramid of Giza, Gru's status suddenly sinks to No. 2. Gru counters his fall by speeding up his plan to shrink and steal the moon, enlisting the help of his army of minions and the elderly Dr. Nefario, but a lack of funding and the difficulties involved in stealing the needed shrink-ray gun threaten to derail everything. Adopting three young orphan girls is an unlikely, but seemingly effective means to further Gru's evil mission, but Gru quickly discovers that caring for three young girls is more work, and distraction, than he could ever have anticipated. What unfolds is an unexpected shift in attitude that will forever change the lives of Gru, Vector, and all three young girls. A visually appealing film produced by Chris Meledandri (Ice Age, Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, and Horton Hears a Who), Despicable Me is full of weirdly shaped characters and settings that are somehow a perfect fit for Sergio Pablos's story. What's especially refreshing is that in this film, 3-D effects are used skillfully and effectively: even when the effects are exploited for comic reasons, they don't become a distraction, as is all too common in many recent movies. The film is full of corny banter and silly antics that inspire plenty of spontaneous laughter, and the minions, while not the best-developed characters, sure are comical. Ultimately, there's also a wholesome message about following one's heart. Steve Carell is the perfect villain-gone-soft in his role as Gru, Jason Segal is quite funny as Vector, and Julie Andrews makes a surprising appearance as Gru's very un-motherly mom. The story isn't new, the humor is relatively juvenile and somewhat forgettable, and it's no Toy Story 3, but Despicable Me celebrates silliness in a way that's satisfying and highly entertaining.

            "description": "With the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Easel, children can create art with paint, chalk, pens, crayons, markers, and more, all at one convenient station. And when art time is over, parents and caregivers will appreciate the two-sided easel's easy-to-clean design. Designed for kids ages three and up, this easel will provide hours of creative activity that is both educational and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nDeluxe Floor-Standing Wooden Easel\r\nAges: 3+\r\n\r\nRequires:\r\nAdult assembly\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat We Think\r\n\r\nFun factor: \r\nDurability: \r\nEase of assembly: \r\nEducational factor: \r\nNovelty factor: \r\n\r\nThe Good: Two-sided easel lets children create art with a variety of different media.\r\n\r\nThe Challenging: Art supplies and paper must be purchased separately.\r\n\r\nIn a Nutshell: Easy-to-clean 2-sided art easel offers ample space for creative expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKids can create art with paint, chalk, pens, crayons, markers, and more, all at one convenient station.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integrated butcher paper roll makes it easy to pull the paper through either side of the easel. (Paper sold separately.)\r\nView larger.\r\nDesigned for Maximum Creativity\r\nThe Melissa & Doug Deluxe Easel features a bi-fold wood frame with two art stations, one on each side, which allows two children to work at one time. It's also designed to let children experiment with several different art media: on one side is a chalkboard, on the other is a dry erase board, and in between the two easel sides is a dowel for holding a butcher paper roll. (Paper must be purchased separately.)\r\n\r\nPull the paper through to either side of the easel for your child to paint or draw. Once the painting is complete, the paper can be torn neatly against the top of the frame and set aside to dry, and a new length of paper can be pulled down for the next art creation. The easel includes sturdy clips that can hold oversized individual art papers onto the easel's surfaces.\r\n\r\nArt Made Easy\r\nEarly childhood education experts say that working on easels offers a variety of valuable learning opportunities for the preschool-aged child. Painting or drawing with large strokes encourages motor development while giving the child the opportunity to experiment with color, shapes, and the varied textures created by different art media.\r\n\r\nOur preschool-aged toy tester enjoyed working on the easel, whether she was drawing with chalk or painting with poster paints. In fact, her creative output increased significantly with the easel. She especially enjoyed mixing paints to make different colors. Like many children her age, she likes standing while engaged in creative play, and the easel makes it much easier for her to draw and paint large pictures without having to reach awkwardly across a table surface or kneel on the floor.\r\n\r\nCleanup, Simplified\r\nAs everyone knows, art can be messy, so that's why parents and caregivers will appreciate the easel's easy-to-clean design. The trays and art boards are held in place with screws that have large plastic knobs for easy loosening and tightening. This allows the trays and board to be easily removed, and washed individually in the sink. (We strongly recommend using only washable paints with this toy.) The easel also folds flat for easy storage: just unscrew the crossbars and close the stand for easy storage against a wall or under a bed."

The TomTom ONE XL is a complete portable GPS vehicle navigation \r\ndevice with an incredible range of features. </font></p>\r\n&nbsp;<p><font size=\"3\">Like TomTom's other navigation systems, the ONE XL gives \r\nyou coverage in all fifty of the United States, as well as Canada--all stored on \r\n1 GB of internal memory. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\">But it's not just the broad geographical coverage that makes \r\nthe TomTom ONE XL special. The user-friendly design also puts it a step above \r\nother navigation systems. The crystal-clear multicolor display makes for \r\nexceptionally easy viewing of maps, routes, driving directions, and other \r\ntraveling information, such as mileage and distance. Measuring 4.3 inches, the \r\nTFT display offers an expanded widescreen view of brilliant two- and \r\nthree-dimensional graphics. The device also features 32 MB RAM and 266 MHz CPU, \r\nmaking it responsive and zippy. Using the USB port and the provided cable, you \r\ncan use your PC to add your own points of interest.

Voice instructions are issued at a speed-sensitive \r\nvolume, so as your vehicle's engine becomes louder or quieter as your speed \r\nchanges, the volume adjusts itself accordingly, guaranteeing clear and easy \r\nlistening. And because voice instructions are available in over 30 languages, \r\njust about anyone will find the TomTom ONE XL to be an invaluable system. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\">With its touch-sensitive screen, the TomTom ONE XL puts \r\nprogramming and operation literally at your fingertips to make sophisticated \r\ntechnology simple.

The \r\nONE XL will also provide a selection of available routes, giving you the option \r\nof avoiding toll roads or choosing between the quickest or the most scenic \r\nroutes. The database includes zip codes to simplify your route selection, and \r\nfor extra convenience, the ONE XL lets you save the addresses of frequent \r\ndestinations, making route planning easier and faster than ever. Other display \r\nfeatures include a compass mode to assist you with directional orientation, and \r\nan anti-glare screen for optimal viewing even in direct sunlight. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\">For additional navigational features to assist with trip \r\nplanning, the built-in Bluetooth connection provides access to TomTom PLUS \r\nsubscription-based services, so that you can tune in to the latest traffic and \r\nweather conditions, as well as download additional city maps, voices, points of \r\ninterest, and much more. The ONE XL adds to these capabilities with FM \r\nradio-based RDS-TMC traffic information as an available accessory (not \r\nincluded). </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\">Weighing less than 10 ounces and measuring 3.4 x 4.7 x 1.2 \r\ninches, the TomTom ONE XL can be easily installed in any vehicle. An included \r\nwindshield suction mount holds it in place. Plus, with an operating temperature \r\nrange of an icy -10 degrees to a sweltering 55 degrees Celsius (14 to 131 \r\ndegrees Fahrenheit), the navigator is durable enough for New England winters or \r\nArizona summers. The TomTom ONE XL is powered by an internal lithium ion battery \r\nthat can be charged from your vehicle's cigarette lighter with the included \r\n12-24V adapter. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b><font size=\"3\">What's in the Box</font></b><font size=\"3\"><br>\r\nTomTom ONE XL device, windshield mount, USB cable, cigarette lighter adaptor, \r\nadhesive mounting disk, TomTom Home DVD, documentation pack, and product code \r\ncard. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the MacBook Air, Apple has created the world's thinnest laptop--measuring an unprecedented 0.16-inches at its thinnest point (and 0.76 inches thick overall). Apple brings its vaunted multi-touch technology, found on the iPhone, to its laptops with the MacBook Air, enabling you to pinch, swipe, or rotate to zoom in on text, advance through a photo album, or adjust an image via the oversized trackpad. And the MacBook Air embodies Apple's continuing environmental progress with its aluminum enclosure, a material highly desired by recyclers; Apple's first mercury-free LCD display with arsenic-free glass; and brominated flame retardant-free material for the majority of circuit boards as well as PVC-free internal cables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MacBook Air includes a vibrant 13.3-inch LED-backlit display and a full-sized keyboard.\r\nDespite the its slender shell, the MacBook Air doesn't skimp on the specifications. It includes a 13.3-inch LED-backlit widescreen display, full-size and backlit keyboard, and a built-in iSight video camera for video conferencing. The MacBook Air is powered by a custom-built 1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which provides an optimized, multithreaded architecture for improved multitasking performance. And it features the integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor, which delivers outstanding 3D game play with up to five times faster graphics performance than the previous generation. Other features include 2 GB of RAM, a 120 GB hard disk drive, Wi-Fi connectivity via 802.11a/b/g/n standards, Mini DisplayPort video output (for DVI and VGA connections), and up to a 4.5-hour battery life.\r\n\r\nIt comes pre-loaded with Apple's Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system, which adds over 300 new features including easy backup of your most important data via Time Machine, a redesigned desktop that helps eliminate clutter, and the newest version of the fast-loading Safari web browser. It also comes with the iLife '08 suite of applications, including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\nThe thinness of MacBook Air is impressive, but even more impressive is that fact that there's a full-size notebook encased in the 0.16 to 0.76 inch of sleek, sturdy anodized aluminum. This svelte, 3-pound laptop has a vibrant, energy efficient 13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display, and its spacious trackpad offers multi-touch gesture support for pinch, rotate and swipe--making it more intuitive than ever to browse and rotate photos or zoom into web pages in Safari. It also features a full-size keyboard that's backlit, making it ideal for dimly lit environments such as airplanes, studios or conference halls. It includes a built-in ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the brightness of the keys as well as the display brightness for optimal visibility. "

It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based \r\nCPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a \r\ncustom ATI graphics processor with 10 MB of embedded DRAM. This is powerful \r\nenough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for \r\ngreat looking games on standard TVs, and even better looking ones on HDTV sets \r\nthanks to built-in support for HDTV (720p/1080i/1080p) resolutions.</font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays \r\nboth the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For \r\ngame-save and media storage, Xbox 360 Arcade System users can choose to stick \r\nwith the Memory Unit included with the bundle, or upgrade to either the \r\ndetachable 20GB hard drive or the 120 GB hard drive (both sold separately). \r\nAlong with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 \r\nbackward-compatible with a large part of the existing Xbox game library.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Control your Game play</b><br>\r\nThe Xbox 360 Arcade System comes with one Xbox 360 Wireless Controller with \r\nrumble. Xbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and \r\nStart buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox \r\nGuide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user &quot;Dashboard&quot; \r\ninterface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal \r\ndigital content like photos songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the \r\nfirst Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above \r\nthe left and right triggers. The Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless \r\ncontrollers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for \r\nstreaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows \r\nXP-based PC. Microsoft has also created a video-conferencing camera, sold \r\nseparately, that will work with the system.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>The Media Experience</b><br>\r\nAll Xbox 360 titles can be played in either standard or high-definition \r\nresolution in 16:9 widescreen, with anti-aliasing for smoother graphics. Game \r\ndesigners will be able to take advantage of the system's multi-channel surround \r\nsound. The Xbox 360's digital media allows users to supplement any game's music \r\nfrom tracks in their own personal library. Five titles are bundled on a single \r\ndisc included with the Xbox 360 Arcade System. These are:</font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\"><i>Feeding Frenzy</i></font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\"><i>Luxor 2</i></font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\"><i>Boom Boom Rocket</i></font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\"><i>Pac-Man Championship Edition</i></font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\"><i>Uno</i></font></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Go LIVE</b><br>\r\nXbox 360's built-in Ethernet port allows users to connect their system to the \r\nXbox LIVE service via their broadband connection. Utilize the free Xbox LIVE \r\nSilver Membership included with your console or upgrade to a Gold Membership to \r\ncreate a Gamer tag and gamer card to express your online identity, chat live \r\nwith voice chat (separately sold headset required), and connect to Xbox LIVE \r\nMarketplace to download free and premium expansions, maps, game demos, movies, \r\nTV shows and other digital content.

            "description": "<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Product Description</b></font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">Color communicates. It introduces you before you say a \r\nword, making the Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph the ultimate \r\nimage-maker. Five fashion-forward hues expressed in pure aluminum add a new \r\nburst of excitement to Canon\u2019s Perpetual Curve design. Of course, a camera that \r\nbrings out the best in you also delivers Canon\u2019s most advanced technology \r\nfeatures. Call it style with substance, for a new level of picture taking \r\npleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph Highlights</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\"><b>8.0-megapixel Digital Elph with 3x optical zoom and \r\noptical image stabilizer</b> With 8.0-megapixel technology at its heart, the \r\nPowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph brings you high-resolution images that maintain \r\ntheir sharpness and vivid impact even when they\u2019re enlarged and cropped. The 3x \r\noptical zoom is a clear winner when it comes to getting up close and personal. \r\nAnd Canon\u2019s invaluable Optical Image Stabilizer reduces the blur of camera \r\nmovement, even in tricky, low-light situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font><p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Enhanced Canon Face Detection Technology</b> \r\nCanon's powerful Face Detection Technology delivers even better results with the \r\nnew SD1100 IS Digital Elph. The Face Detection Technology continues to recognize \r\nfaces in a scene, and concentrate exposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon \r\nthem. But the SD1100 IS Digital Elph adds more: Face Detection WB means the \r\ncamera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best \r\npossible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the SD1100 IS Digital Elph user \r\nhighlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that \r\nperson, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a \r\npowerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection Technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Motion Detection Technology automatically reduces blur</b> Life doesn\u2019t stand \r\nstill for picture-taking. That\u2019s why Canon included its advanced Motion \r\nDetection Technology in the PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph. This sophisticated \r\nfeature works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is \r\nmoving. Then it automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO \r\nsettings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\">When you need higher ISOs for action-stopping shutter \r\nspeeds, Motion Detection Technology provides it. But when no movement is \r\ndetected, it allows lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. So whether you\u2019re \r\nshooting a bride walking down the aisle, a ballet recital or even a child\u2019s \r\nsoccer game, you can relax and shoot with confidence knowing you\u2019ve got the \r\npicture you intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Selectable Shooting modes</b> With 18 Shooting Modes including 9 Special \r\nScene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font><p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>2.5-inch PureColor LCD II for bright, \r\naccurate color</b> The PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph gives you large 2.5-inch \r\nLCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD \r\nII offers more spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an \r\nangle (compared to PureColor LCD). The screen is highly durable and easy to see \r\nin any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features \r\nNight Display for easy viewing in low light -- a perfect feature for gathering \r\nfriends and family around to see your images. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DIGIC III Image Processor for sharper images and improved functionality</b> \r\nWith DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top \r\nefficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s \r\nFace Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more \r\ntrue-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the \r\ncamera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal \r\nfocus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face \r\nlooking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two \r\nways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face \r\nDetection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as \r\nthey're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible \r\nto correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the SD1100 IS \r\nDigital Elph's menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>iSAPS Technology</i> is an entirely original scene-recognition technology \r\ndeveloped for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands \r\nof different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to \r\nimprove focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Red-eye correction</b> Red-eye Correction provides three options for removing \r\nred-eye from subjects in flash pictures. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually \r\n\tidentifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\r\n\t</font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The SD1100 IS Digital Elph can be set to \r\n\tautomatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. </font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The user can manually locate any red eyes in a \r\n\tscene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to \r\n\tremove them. </font></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\"><br>\r\n<b>High ISO</b> The PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph features ISO 1600 and High \r\nISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects \r\nin low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Complete Print Solution</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PowerShot SD1100 features a Print/Share button for easy direct printing and \r\ndownloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select Pixma photo \r\nprinters and Selphy compact photo printers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing \r\neasier than ever. Simply connect the SD1100 IS Digital Elph to a Canon Pixma \r\nphoto printer or Selphy compact photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo \r\nprinter, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the \r\nPrint/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrint your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function \r\nto output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon \r\nSelphy compact photo printer. </font>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The purpose of the small internal memory is to store a \r\nfew pictures in order to display them on your frame when you do not have a \r\nmemory card inserted into the frame. The internal memory on your digital photo \r\nframe is a fixed amount and cannot be expanded. However, you can increase the \r\namount of pictures that can be displayed by using memory cards with a larger \r\nmemory capacity. The digital photo frame features two built-in memory card \r\nreaders for easy viewing and sharing of photos stored on the memory cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>View USB flash drive photos without a PC</b> A USB \r\nconnector for easy viewing and sharing of photos stored on USB flash drive. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><br>\r\n<b>Auto turning display on/off at preset times for power saving</b> A timer \r\nturns PhotoFrame on and off at the hours you select, reducing energy consumption \r\nfor the sake of our environment saving up to one third of your PhotoFrame energy \r\ncosts.

The screen size should be the size of \r\nthe visible display and not include the surrounding frame.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Resolution</b><br>\r\nThe resolution is the number of pixels that a digital photo frame can display. \r\nThe higher the resolution the crisper the image. A high resolution is most \r\nimportant on large screens in order to avoid a blurred or pixilated display of \r\nyour pictures. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Aspect Ratio</b><br>\r\nAn image\u2019s aspect ratio represents a comparison of its width to height. A few \r\nframes can display images in an HDTV aspect ratio of 16:9 but most use the TV \r\naspect ratio of 4:3. This means for every 4 units of width there are 3 units of \r\nheight. The larger the gap between the two numbers the wider the display is \r\ngoing to be. Some digital photo frames automatically crop pictures to fit the \r\ndisplay\u2019s aspect ratio. If you have a frame that does crop photos with an aspect \r\nratio different from the screen's aspect ratio, two sides of the photo are \r\ncropped so the screen is filled by the central portion of the image. Keep in \r\nmind, if you display portrait oriented images on a screen with a wide aspect \r\nratio, they will either be very small on the screen or heavily cropped. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Frame Style</b><br>\r\nA lot of the time your digital photo frame will be turned off so you want to \r\nensure that the frame itself looks nice even when it isn\u2019t displaying your \r\nfavorite photos.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Memory Cards </b><br>\r\nMemory cards increase the number of photos the frame can display. The amount of \r\npictures that can be displayed is limited to the size of the memory card. Try to \r\nfind a frame that is compatible with the memory card you use in your camera. \r\nThat way you\u2019ll be able to switch your memory card between your camera and frame \r\nwith ease.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Internal Memory</b><br>\r\nInternal memory refers to the space or number of pictures the digital photo \r\nframe can save and store without the help of a memory card. Usually, the amount \r\nof internal memory is small. If you are hoping to display a large (or even \r\nmoderate) amount of photos on your frame consider looking into purchasing a \r\nmemory card with a large amount of memory space.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Optional Batteries</b><br>\r\nMost digital photo frames rely on AC power to run. However, some frames have \r\nbuilt-in rechargeable batteries. Frames with rechargeable batteries are ideal if \r\nyou plan on hanging your frame on the wall. This means the unsightly trailing \r\nwires will be seen only when the frame is being charged.</font></p>"

It\u2019s got 8 megapixels, a 4x \r\noptical zoom, an Optical Image Stabilizer, and a large 2.5-inch LCD. A range of \r\nshooting modes -- from manual to automatic, including Canon\u2019s new Easy Mode -- \r\nmake picture-taking carefree. A DIGIC III Image Processor with Enhanced Canon \r\nFace Detection assures natural-looking results, while Motion Detection \r\nTechnology reduces blur. For added creativity, attach wide or telephoto \r\nconverter lenses. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><br>\r\n<b>Canon PowerShot A590IS Highlights</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>8 megapixels with 4x optical zoom and optical image \r\nstabilizer</b> With the PowerShot A590 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have \r\nnever been easier to shoot and share. The 8.0-megapixel design lets you create \r\nimpressive high resolution images of family and friends you\u2019ll be proud display. \r\nThe genuine Canon 4x zoom lens moves you in for powerful close-ups -- like a \r\nbird in flight or a child\u2019s winning goal -- at the touch of a button. Plus, \r\nCanon\u2019s highly sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer keeps every shot \r\nabsolutely steady even when you\u2019re not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>2.5-inch LCD screen</b> The camera\u2019s 2.5-inch LCD \r\nscreen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing \r\noff your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright \r\npicture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>New Easy Mode simplifies operation</b> Even if you\u2019ve \r\nnever picked up a camera before, with Canon\u2019s new Easy Mode you can take \r\ninspiring, dramatic pictures that will impress everyone. Once you choose Easy \r\nMode, the PowerShot A590 IS handles all the details automatically. It \r\nautomatically sets every camera control including the flash to reduce blur and \r\nimprove image quality. So you get pictures that are bright, clear and natural \r\njust by pushing a button. Best of all, you can relax and concentrate on what \r\nreally counts -- your subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Selectable shooting modes</b> With 19 Shooting Modes \r\nincluding 7 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>DIGIC III Image Processor</b> With DIGIC III, your \r\nimages boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery \r\nlife is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection \r\nTechnology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people \r\nshots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera \r\nautomatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus \r\npoint. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face \r\nlooking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two \r\nways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face \r\nDetection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as \r\nthey're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible \r\nto correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the A590 IS's \r\nmenu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>iSAPS Technology</i> is an entirely original scene-recognition technology \r\ndeveloped for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands \r\nof different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to \r\nimprove focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Face Detection Technology</b> Canon's powerful Face \r\nDetection Technology delivers even better results with the new A590 IS. The Face \r\nDetection Technology continues to recognize faces in a scene, and concentrate \r\nexposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon them. But the A590 IS adds more: \r\nFace Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating \r\nwhite balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the \r\nA590 IS user highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera \r\nconcentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection \r\nTechnology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection \r\nTechnology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Red-eye Correction</b> Red-eye Correction provides \r\nthree options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. <br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually \r\n\tidentifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\r\n\t</font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The A590 IS can be set to automatically detect and \r\n\tcorrect red-eye during image playback. </font></li>\r\n\t<li><font face=\"Verdana\">The user can manually locate any red eyes in a \r\n\tscene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to \r\n\tremove them. </font></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>High ISO</b> The PowerShot A590 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto \r\nsettings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in \r\nlow-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font><p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Motion Detection Technology \r\nautomatically reduces blur</b> Life doesn\u2019t stand still for picture-taking. \r\nThat\u2019s why Canon included its advanced Motion Detection Technology in the \r\nPowerShot A590 IS. This sophisticated feature works in the background to \r\ninstantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving.

And more than just communicating over chat and VoIP, webcams are \r\nincreasingly used to broadcast Truman Show-esque live video feeds of one's every \r\nmove (such as at Justin.tv) as well as high-quality mini-movies uploaded to \r\nsharing sites. And that's where the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 really shines, \r\nwith its 2-megapixel image sensor, smooth-tracking autofocus, high-end Carl \r\nZeiss optics, and HD video capabilities (with the capability of recording video \r\nat 960 by 720 pixels). </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\">First, a little about Logitech's touted technological and \r\noptical advantages. Designed by Carl Zeiss (known for high-end film and digital \r\ncamera lenses), the Pro 9000's optics use a five-element lens arranged into four \r\noptical elements. As a result, the lens focuses the light onto the sensor with \r\nmaximum detail and minimal aberrations. The 2-megapixel lens also offers an \r\nautofocus mechanism that automatically adjusts as your face moves about. It also \r\nincorporates Logitech's RightLight and RightSound technologies, which improves \r\nthe webcam's image quality under difficult lighting conditions and provides \r\nnoise cancellation, respectively. </font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">We found the autofocus feature to be much smoother than \r\nanother similarly specced webcam from Creative that we previously reviewed \r\n(which felt stuttery to our video chat partners), and the RightLight feature was \r\nable to render an image of our face in both highly backlit and low-light \r\nsituations--something that other webcams we've tested have completely failed at. \r\nAnd the combination of RightLight, Carl Zeiss optics, and the two-megapixel \r\nsensor helped to enrich both the clarity and the color of our images. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">While it's true that broadband Internet has gained \r\nspeed, unfortunately none of the major chat or VoIP programs are can stream the \r\nhigh-definition video (960 by 720 pixels) that the Pro 9000 can capture. Thus, \r\nthis feature is really only usable for recording video to your hard drive and \r\neither uploading to a video sharing service like YouTube or for inclusion into a \r\nmovie project to be burned to disc. The Pro 9000 also enables you to take still \r\nimages at larger than its native 2-megapixel sensor via software interpolation \r\n(up to an 8-megapixel resolution). Note, however, that shooting at a higher \r\nresolution causes a lengthier shutter lag. </font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The Pro 9000 offers easy plug-and-play operability on \r\neither a Windows PC or a Mac--just slide in the USB 2.0 plug, select the camera \r\nfrom your chosen video chatting program (it works seamlessly with Skype, Yahoo!, \r\nWindows Live, SightSpeed, and iChat), and you're good to go. While the Pro 9000 \r\nworks brilliantly right out of the box, you'll only be able to take advantage of \r\nsoftware add-ons such using the included QuickCam software (which is for Windows \r\nusers only). </font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The QuickCam Control Panel is where you can select from \r\na host of special effect add-ons that range from a selection of avatars (such as \r\na dinosaur or cat) to facial accessories (including a crown and Borg hardware), \r\nand a variety of filter effects. The avatars didn't seem especially responsive \r\nunless we were overly hyperactive, but the limited face add-ons and filters were \r\nmore successful (with our favorite being the rotoscope animation effect). </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The double-hinged clip on the back of the lightweight \r\nPro 9000 can be articulated to fit both the thinnest notebook screens to thicker \r\nLCD TV/monitors. A rubberized is placed right below the camera housing to help \r\nprevent slippage, and the camera itself can smoothly tilt up and down about 90 \r\ndegrees. The Pro 9000 has a single microphone on its right side, and while the \r\nleft side has a control button that automatically opens the Logitech QuickCam \r\nsoftware. And in the middle is a Logitech logo, which is given a red glowing \r\nhalo when the camera is recording. It uses a single USB connection that does not \r\nrequire external power. </font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">With its arsenal of optical advancements combined with \r\nan invitingly affordable price tag and easy portability, the QuickCam Pro 9000 \r\nis a great alternative to the standard VGA/1.3-megapixel cams built into \r\nnotebooks.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

The Leapster Learning Game System takes the \r\nbrain-building principles that Leapfrog laid out in its early electronic \r\nlearning devices (which have an interactive book format) and applies them to a \r\nvideo-game format. Leapster draws kids in with familiar video game templates\u2014all \r\nof which have a secret weapon: a built-in learning component. LeapFrog hopes \r\nthat kids will become so engaged in the gaming aspects and familiar television \r\nand movie characters offered by this toy that they won\u2019t even notice they\u2019re \r\nlearning and reinforcing valuable reading, math, and language skills.</font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\">Aimed at kids ages 4 to 10 years, the 6-by-4-inch Leapster \r\nis sized for little hands and comfortably shaped with safe, rounded edges. The \r\n2.25-inch touch screen is ample for most of the gaming activities; although a \r\nlittle cluttered when used for the art and drawing modules. Buttons are suitably \r\nplaced on either side of the unit for thumb-operated control. The right side \r\nfeatures &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; buttons for selecting settings and answers, while the left \r\nhas a multi-directional gamepad for game play. A stylus is also attached for \r\ndrawing, selecting tools and settings, and dragging and placing objects. The \r\n3-inch backlit display makes games visible in the dark (although parents will \r\nprefer that the Leapster is shut off at bedtime) and the animated graphics, \r\nwhile not completely state-of-the-art, are well done and suitable for this age \r\nrange.</font>&nbsp;</p>  \r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">As with the manufacturer\u2019s LeapPad products, the \r\nLeapster does require the purchase of additional cartridges to expand its \r\ncapabilities. Kids can choose from a star-studded list of their favorite \r\ncharacters to play educational games with, such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Thomas \r\nthe Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, Nemo, Cinderella, Batman, and more. \r\nLeapfrog\u2019s own cartoon star, Tad, narrates a few as well. While stocking up on \r\nthe extra software titles can get expensive, it gives parents some control and \r\ninput on which characters they\u2019d like their kids to learn from. Plus, characters \r\nfor these titles are appropriately matched to the maturity of the targeted grade \r\nlevel (pre-K through 4th grade).</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\">Starting up or hitting the Home button takes players to the \r\nmain menu. There is one pre-loaded game that children will likely come back to \r\nagain and again. <i>Rabbit River</i> is based on the <i>Frogger</i> game format \r\nbut with an additional learning element. In letters mode, kids guide their bunny \r\nto hop floating logs to the other side of the river while jumping on specific \r\nletters to identify them or spell out a requested 3- or 4-letter word. In \r\nnumbers mode, the bunny must land on specific numbers on the logs to skip count \r\nby twos or form a correct equation. Another pre-loaded activity is <i>Color \r\nCorral</i>, an interactive coloring book designed to boost creative \r\nproblem-solving skills. This module is like a kid\u2019s version of Photoshop and \r\noffers a variety of scenic templates, colors, tools, and moving icons that kids \r\ncan combine for an infinite number of possibilities. The included manual gives \r\nsuggestions on how to reinforce these math, reading, and art concepts in the \r\nreal world.</font>&nbsp;</p>  \r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">Each game offers multiple skill levels so kids can ease \r\ninto new territory at the beginner level, then challenge themselves with more \r\nadvanced learning problems as they understand the concept. If kids are stumped \r\nat any point during a game, they can hit the Hint button and receive a friendly \r\npush in the right direction from an animated tutor, Edison the firefly. Edison \r\nalso appears automatically if kids answer a question incorrectly several times \r\nin a row and coaches the child to reach the correct answer. The Pause button \r\nlets kids stop the game for a snack break and pick back up again where they left \r\noff.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">Designed for portability, the Leapster fits easily in a \r\nbackpack or tote bag and is ideal for more purposeful edutainment on the go, \r\nwhether a quick game on the bus to school or hours of playtime during vacation \r\ntravel. This learning system runs on four AA batteries </font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Verdana\"><br>\r\nThe Leapster Handheld Learning System teaches your child by playing with them! \r\nPlay and learn essential pre-K through 2nd grade skills, with one interactive \r\nsystem. Children will educate themselves through action-packed learning games \r\nfor reading, math, critical and creative thinking, story comprehension, \r\nvocabulary, and much more! Backlit screen for easy viewing Headphone jack for \r\nquiet play. The Leapster software library features games for pre-K through 4th \r\ngrade.

It features a stylish white resin case and silver \r\ntop ring, which frames a white dial face with three light silver digital \r\nsubdials (which display day, date, and the 1/100-second stopwatch). Other timing \r\nfeatures include world time from 48 cities, 12/24-hour display, autocalendar (to \r\nthe year 2099), and hourly time signal. This watch is water resistant to 100 \r\nmeters (330 feet), suitable for recreational snorkeling. It also offers a \r\ntapered white resin strap, scratch-resistant mineral crystal, and AfterGlow LED \r\nelectro-luminescent backlight. </font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">This radio-controlled watch receives a time calibration \r\nsignal transmitted from Fort Collins, Colorado, and signal reception is possible \r\nwithin a radius of about 2,000 miles from the Fort Collins transmitter. You can \r\nchoose to automatically receive this signal four times a day, or manually update \r\nthe watch to the atomic clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>History of G-Shock</b><br>\r\nIn 1983, Casio launched the shock-resistant G-SHOCK watch. This product \r\nshattered the notion that a watch is a fragile piece of jewelry that needs to be \r\nhandled with care, and was the result of Casio engineers taking on the challenge \r\nof creating the world\u2019s toughest watch. Using a triple-protection design for the \r\nparts, module, and case, the G-SHOCK offered a radical new type of watch that \r\nwas unaffected by strong impacts or shaking. Its practicality was immediately \r\nrecognized, and its unique look, which embodied its functionality, became wildly \r\npopular, resulting in explosive sales in the early 1990s. The G-SHOCK soon \r\nadopted various new sensors, solar-powered radio-controlled technology \r\n(described below), and new materials for even better durability. By always \r\nemploying the latest technology, and continuing to transcend conventional \r\nthinking about the watch, the G-SHOCK brand has become Casio\u2019s flagship \r\ntimepiece product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>G-Shock and Baby-G Brand</b><br>\r\nG-Shock represents the inner force that\u2019s within all of us and it\u2019s with this \r\ninner force that G-Shock was developed more than two decades ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo engineers, with a vision to create the ultimate watch, assembled a rogue \r\nteam of engineers and named their mission, &quot;Project Tough.&quot; Through perseverance \r\nand unusual testing methods, such as throwing prototypes out the second floor \r\nbathroom window to the asphalt below, they developed the first G-Shock in 1983. \r\nThis watch was able to withstand their then benchmark of &quot;Triple Ten&quot; criteria, \r\nnamely 10 years of usage, 10 atmospheres (water resistance) and a 10m fall \r\n(shock resistance).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday more than two decades later, G-Shock watches have exceeded the designers\u2019 \r\noriginal benchmark and pushed the limits of what a watch can endure. With 200M \r\nwater resistance &amp; shock resistance at the heart G-Shock\u2019s strength and numerous \r\ntechnological advances such as Tough Solar Power and Atomic Timekeeping, you\u2019ll \r\nhave no doubt why G-Shock is called the Toughest Watch in the World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<li><font face=\"Verdana\">All G-Shock and Baby-G watches are shock resistant. \r\nTheir unique shock absorbing structure supports the module (inner brains) as if \r\nit were floating in air. </font></li>\r\n<li><font face=\"Verdana\">All G-Shock watches are 200M (20 bar or 660 ft) water \r\nresistant. Baby-G watches are 100 to 200M water resistant depending on the \r\nmodel. </font></li>\r\n<li><font face=\"Verdana\">All G-Shocks use mineral glass for added toughness. \r\nBaby-Gs are either mineral glass or plastic glass depending on the model. </font>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

The 510 is comfortable and light enough for all \r\nday wear, and it offers unprecedented clarity and sound quality. These are great \r\nfeatures, but the real revolution involves Plantronics' exclusive &quot;Multipoint&quot; \r\ntechnology, which allows the headset to function as a powerful communication \r\nsolution for up to two Bluetooth devices. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Verdana\">With Multipoint technology you can switch between your \r\nvoice-enabled Bluetooth mobile phone, PDA or laptop. The headset's &quot;smart&quot; \r\ntechnology knows which device you are using and allows you to take calls from \r\nany device at the touch of a button. With the optional Plantronics Bluetooth \r\nDeskphone Adapter you can even switch between your office phone and your \r\nBluetooth mobile phone. You'll never need to use a dedicated &quot;landline&quot; phone \r\nheadset again. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Verdana\">The 510 features a noise-canceling microphone for clearer \r\nconversations, and it folds for easy storage. The boom also swivels for perfect \r\npositioning on either ear. One-touch call control buttons are placed for easy \r\naccess, and you can easily redial the last number dialed and initiate \r\nvoice-activated calls from the headset. Because the 510 is Bluetooth-enabled (it \r\nsupports the Bluetooth 1.2 specification) you can roam up to 33 feet from your \r\nBluetooth device. Meanwhile, the 510 supports adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) \r\nwhich helps avoid interference from wi-fi networks. Ample talk time is provided \r\nby the built-in rechargeable battery; you'll get up to 6 hours talk time and up \r\nto 100 hours of standby time.</font></p>\r\n"

Founded in Paris \r\nin 1847 by Louis-Francois Cartier, the company became renowned worldwide for its \r\ndesign and production of beautiful jewelry and opulent objets d\u2019art. A royal \r\ncommission in 1904 made Cartier a supplier to Europe\u2019s Crowned Heads of State \r\nand led England\u2019s King Edward VII to describe Louis Cartier, grandson of the \r\nfounder, as the jeweler of Kings, the King among jewellers.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">By the early 20th century, Cartier had expanded its \r\ncollection to include watches. At a time when pocket watches were still \r\nconsidered de rigueur for the distinguished gentleman, Cartier helped popularize \r\nthe wristwatch, making it a bold fashion statement for men and women as well as \r\na status symbol among the well-to-do. Louis Cartier is credited with creating \r\nthe first men\u2019s wristwatch, the Santos, in 1904. He developed and named the \r\nwatch for his client and friend, the Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, \r\nwho needed a device that would allow him to read the time without taking his \r\nhands off the controls of his airplane. Other classic designs followed, \r\nincluding Cartier's signature timepiece, the Tank, in 1917, and later Cartier's \r\nfirst water-resistant watch, the Pasha, created especially for the Pasha of \r\nMarrakesh. </font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">Treasured by collectors, Cartier watches are \r\ndistinguished by their impressive variety of shapes (round, square, oval, Tank, \r\nTortue and Tonneau), by their exceptional materials and workmanship, and by \r\ntheir recognizable Cartier aesthetic, an elegant blend of classic and modern \r\ndesign. <br>\r\n</font><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

Plus, you get advanced features, such as automatic face \r\ntracking software and low-light adjustment, so you feel like you're right there.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Verdana\">The Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 is optimized for \r\nWindows Live Messenger, which is used by the largest worldwide instant messenger \r\ncommunity with over 200 million users. Three key features give you a superior \r\nWindows Live Experience. First, the Windows Live Call Button makes it easy to \r\nstart a video call. Simply press the button to see who's online, and you're on \r\nyour way to a video call. Second, with the LifeCam Dashboard you can access \r\nvideo effects and control your webcam from the Windows Live Messenger window. \r\nLastly, with One-Touch Blogging, a single click allows you to upload to Windows \r\nLive Spaces, an &quot;online scrapbook&quot; that lets you easily post blogs, photo \r\nalbums, and personal music lists. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Verdana\">The VX-3000's automatic face tracking software, \r\nwhich takes advantage of the camera's pan, tilt, and zoom controls, follows you \r\nso you don't disappear off-screen. Meanwhile, the camera automatically adjusts \r\nfor low-light conditions for improved video quality, and a built-in \r\nunidirectional microphone with acoustic noise cancellation provides \r\ncrystal-clear audio. Video effects give you a fun way to express yourself, and \r\nlast but not least, the camera's universal attachment base fits on most \r\nmonitors, including flat screens. Alternatively, the camera can sit directly on \r\nyour desk. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Verdana\">Note that while the VX-3000 is optimized for \r\nuse with Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft LifeCams also work with other instant \r\nmessaging programs, such as Yahoo Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\" size=\"3\">If you want the next level of performance \r\nfrom your LifeCam, consider the Microsoft LifeCam VX-6000, \r\nwhich adds high definition video capabilities, a wide angle lens, a 3x digital \r\nzoom, and a high-speed USB connection. </font></p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n"

Measuring a mere six inches long and weighing only a half \r\npound, these small but mighty choppers are made for indoor dueling -- so you \r\ndon\u2019t have to quit flying just because of bad weather or a dark sky. A \r\ncrash-resistant foam fuselage means you can perfect your piloting skills using \r\nthe dual-toggle, single-throttle wireless controller. The twin drive props in \r\nback and dual rotors on top provide exceptional stability and precise six-way \r\ndirectional control -- up, down, left, right, forward, and back. Sled-style \r\nlanding gear means set-downs should be gentle, too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\nNot just for meant flying solo, the Havoc copters are designed for fun with \r\nothers. In what is almost like a live video game, each helicopter uses its \r\ninfrared beam weapons to engage in a mid-air battle against the other. The first \r\npilot to hit his opponent three times with the beam (complete with battle \r\nsounds) will be victorious as the enemy heads into a wild tailspin. Six AA \r\nbatteries are required, but not included, for the remote controls. The \r\nhelicopters are powered by rechargeable lithium batteries, and the charger comes \r\nwith the set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n   \r\n&nbsp;</body></html>"

Simply connect the Smart Cycle to your television's input \r\njacks, insert the included game cartridge &quot;key,&quot; and your child can start riding \r\n-- and learning -- right away! Your child pedals the bike to keep the game going \r\nand &quot;steers&quot; with the movable handlebars. A large, easy-to-use and conveniently \r\nplaced joy stick and bright buttons control the games and educational tools.</font>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The Smart Cycle comes with a &quot;learning adventure,&quot; in \r\nwhich your child drives a car by pedaling the bike and turning the handlebars. \r\nShe can splash through mud puddles and take treacherous corners as she tries to \r\ncatch letters of the alphabet along the road. She'll learn to keep pedaling to \r\nkeep moving, while at the same time learning her alphabet!</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>Versatility Adds to the Fun</b><br>\r\nThe Smart Cycle includes a game cartridge that features several fun and \r\neducational adventures that will keep your child happily entertained. A trip to \r\n&quot;Math Mountain&quot; will help her practice her numbers, while an adventure-filled \r\ntrek to &quot;Shape Lake&quot; will introduce her to a wide array of different shapes. The \r\nSmart Cycle also includes an exciting car racing game that two children can play \r\nat the same time, while a &quot;creative journal&quot; lets your child create pictures and \r\nsnapshots of her &quot;worldwide&quot; travels.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The fun doesn't have to stop when your child gets her \r\nfill of exercise: she can stop and rest, and continue the fun and learning by \r\nusing the bike's joy stick and buttons to navigate through many other games and \r\nadventures. And best of all, several optional game cartridges that can be used \r\nwith the Smart Cycle (sold separately) will keep your child continually \r\nentertained, including games that feature favorite characters such as Dora the \r\nExplorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Barbie, and Hot Wheels cars.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">With its wide array of games and height-adjustable seat, \r\nthe Smart Cycle is designed to grow with your child. So as your child grows both \r\nphysically and intellectually, the Smart Cycle will grow with her.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\"><b>The Ultimate Test Drive</b><br>\r\nWe found the Smart Cycle easy to assemble and very simple to install with our \r\ntelevision set. All we needed for assembly was a Phillips screwdriver and four \r\n&quot;D&quot; batteries (not included). As long as your television or VCR is equipped with \r\nthe red, white, and yellow RCA jacks to connect the Smart Cycle, you're set to \r\ngo. We simply connected the included plugs to the television's jacks, turned the \r\ntelevision on, and we were ready for hours of fun. Once the game started, the \r\ncycle seemed easy enough to operate, making it not too much of a challenge to \r\nresult in frustrating a child, but not so easy that it would soon become boring. \r\nWith the additional optional game cartridges, we believe the Smart Cycle \r\npromises to be a long-lasting source of entertainment.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">The Smart Cycle comes with an easy-to-follow instruction \r\nmanual, and the set-up only took a few minutes. However, one minor set-back we \r\nexperience was that we needed the paper instruction manual on hand to understand \r\nhow to play the video game; we found some elements of the games to be nearly \r\nimpossible to understand without the instructions. An intuitive set of online \r\ninstructions designed for children to follow, without the need to consult a \r\npaper manual, would make for a near-ideal gaming experience for any child (and \r\nparent). Also, although the seat offers four height levels, the handlebars are \r\nnot height adjustable, which may present a problem for some smaller children.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Verdana\">Developmental Benefits: Teaches: upper &amp; lowercase \r\nletters, numbers &amp; counting, spelling, problem-solving, shapes, matching, \r\ncreativity, spatial reasoning, motor skills &amp; lots more! Requires 4 &quot;D&quot; \r\nbatteries, not included. Measures 26.7&quot;L x 18.5&quot;W x 25.1&quot;H. Weight Capacity 200 \r\nlbs.</font></p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\nAn awesome, prehistoric friend, KOTA The Triceratops Dinosaur from Playskool is ready to accompany your imaginative child on all kinds of adventures. With lots of sound effects, including music, munching, stomping, and roaring, this baby dinosaur is a realistic creation. He even moves his head and tail and blinks his eyes. KOTA is built so that curious kids three and older and up to 60 pounds can enjoy a bouncing ride<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Make Friends With Your New Pet: A Baby Dinosaur</b><br>\r\nBefore you child goes for his or her first ride, an adult will need to prep KOTA. The included instruction booklet makes it easy to snap his tail in place and secure his furry coat over it. There's also an excellent illustration of how to use a Philips head screwdriver to insert six \"D\" cell batteries (not included) in KOTA's belly to provide power.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce the batteries are in, just flip KOTA's power switch to \"Play\" or \"Music\" mode and start having fun. In music mode, bouncing on the dinosaurs back inspires four different dino adventure theme songs. In play mode, 10 different sensors help this triceratops respond to your child's actions.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen you touch KOTA's nose with your hand, he will \"sniff\" it. Tickling his belly or chin makes him \"laugh,\" and when you feed him by putting an object in his mouth, he responds by munching on it. There's also touch sensors in his three horns, on his tail, and on his two sides. A sound sensor in KOTA's forehead helps him know when your child is \"roaring\" a dino greeting, and a weight sensor in his back ensures that he knows when there's a rider to entertain.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Realistic Design with Soft, Kid-Friendly Features</b><br>\r\nWe really appreciated the way this green and brown Triceratops looks scaly and realistic from far away, despite the fact that his hide is soft, furry, and kid-friendly. And his wide, blinking eyes combined with the way he wiggles his horns and tosses his head make it seem like he has a personality all his own.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhether kids play with their pet dino alone or invite friends over and take turns exploring the jungles, marshes, and deserts of the prehistoric world, there's lots of possibilities for make-believe fun that can be inspired by bouncing on the spring seat in this dino's back. A hidden handle on the back of his neck helps kids hold on, so they can bounce without slipping off. For a brief instant, we were disappointed that KOTA bounced in place instead of actually walking, but then we realized that this is one of the design factors that makes him so stable, safe, and durable.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, KOTA is a fun, unique, animatronic playmate that your child won't quickly forget. At more than three-feet long and just over two-and-a-half-feet tall, KOTA is big. Also, even though it includes an handle for your child to hold on to, slips and spills are a possibility. It's likely that you'll need to watch smaller children with an especially close eye when they are first adjusting to what it feels like to ride on a dinosaur.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd while KOTA's large size is what makes him so much fun, it can also make him tricky to pick up and move around. He's one toy that your child will have to keep at home. And for parents, once you've heard the dino theme songs several times, you'll appreciate the convenient volume control. The power-saving \"sleep\" mode that goes into effect when it has been 60-90 seconds since your dinosaur's last human interaction will also be a big winner with parents.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the Box</b><br>\r\nTriceratops, tail, leafy snack, and instruction manual.

It fits snugly behind the ear and doesn't \r\n\tmove even when I shake my head. The design would be better if the earpiece \r\n\twent a little deeper into the ear to provide better sound and volume. The \r\n\tbuttons were a little hard to identify by touch when wearing the headset, so \r\n\tit takes getting used to. If the phone call volume is all the way up, and \r\n\tthe headset volume is all the way up, it still needs a little more volume in \r\n\tareas with some noise to contend with, but otherwise it does the job well. \r\n\tPairing and connecting with the phone is very easy. At the price, it's a \r\n\tgreat buy and definitely satisfactory. <br>\r\n\t&nbsp;</font></div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

His vision was to create remarkable timepieces that pushed the \r\nenvelope of innovation and precision. The company's reputation grew and Heuer's \r\nfirst patent for a chronograph mechanism in 1882 was followed by a long list of \r\nachievements: the first stopwatch accurate to 1/100 of a second, the first \r\ndashboard stopwatch for race cars, the first miniature electronic timekeeping \r\ndevice accurate to 1/1000th of a second, and the first automatic movement with a \r\nmicrorotor, to name just a few. Heuer's reputation for gold-standard precision \r\nearned the company the privilege of providing official timing services for a \r\nnumber of world-class competitive sporting events, including the Olympic Games, \r\nthe FIS Ski World Cup, and the FIA Formula 1 World Championships. To this day, \r\nTAG Heuer maintains a close association with the world of competitive sports and \r\nenjoys a devoted following among sports celebrities and enthusiasts. In 1985, \r\nHeuer joined the TAG (Techniques D'Avant-Garde) group, and the TAG Heuer name \r\nand logo were created. Now one of the most recognized and sought-after watch \r\nbrands in the world, TAG Heuer continues its reputation of innovative design and \r\ntechnological excellence. <br>\r\n</span></font><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\nElmo fans will delight in Elmo Live! This latest version of everyone's favorite Sesame Street character has Elmo talking, singing, telling jokes, and a lot more. With an interactive style, Elmo Live! encourages creative play, and with his wide variety of actions, he can entertain a kids through different stages of their development, from 18 months onward.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Moving, Talking, Dancing Elmo!</b><br>\r\nElmo Live! features the furry, bright-red exterior and the big eyes characteristic of the popular Sesame Street character. He features complex actions that give him a life-like quality: His mouth and head move while he talks, sings, and tells stories; he gestures with his arms, and he moves his legs. He even crosses his legs when he sits on the included stool.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe found him very easy to play with -- just press his buttons to get him going. Press Elmo's foot and he will sit down on his stool to tell you a story. He even gestures to act out parts of his stories! Squeeze his nose, and he'll make a variety of silly sounds; he'll even ask you if you \"have his nose\" and ask you to give it back to him. Squeeze his hand, and he'll dance. Elmo even blows kisses, asks for hugs, and says he loves you. He tells jokes, acts ticklish, and more.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen he's laid on his back, or if your child doesn't play with him for a while, Elmo will go into a battery-save mode. He'll yawn, say he's tired, and shut down. Just press one of his buttons to get him going again.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b> Interactive Fun for Kids of Many Ages</b><br>\r\nWe particularly enjoyed that, unlike some other \"talking\" toys, Elmo Live! doesn't just spout programmed phrases. Instead, he asks for interaction, and he responds as if your child is responding to him. For example, when he will ask for a hug and then say \"thank you\" as if he's received one, or he'll say he's ticklish and then will \"respond\" as if your child is tickling him. This makes an almost magical experience for your child, as if her toy is really coming to life.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe wide variety of things that Elmo Live! can do makes him a great toy to grow with your child. Younger children can engage in cause-and-effect play by simply pressing Elmo's buttons to see what he does. Our two-year-old tester was especially delighted with the silly sounds Elmo makes when his nose is squeezed. Understandably, her attention meandered during the somewhat lengthy stories. However, an older child will have the attention span and comprehension skills to appreciate them, as well as the silly jokes that Elmo tells.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the Box</b><br><br>\r\nElmo Live! doll, with 6 AA batteries included"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\nWinner of the 2007 T.O.T.Y. Award for Best Girls Toy of the Year, the Hasbro FurReal Friends Butterscotch Pony seeks to fulfill every little girl's dream of having her very own pony. Butterscotch is a miniature Shetland pony, and will react to your child's loving care in incredibly realistic ways. More than three feet tall, she will even allow kids to sit on her for a pretend ride. Recommended for ages 4 through 10, Butterscotch Pony will quickly become any little girl's most precious companion.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Just Like a Real Pony</b><br>\r\nWith Butterscotch, your girl will feel like she is interacting with a living, breathing pony. Butterscotch is soft to the touch, with a fur coat and mane that feel just like a real pony. Her markings and color are modeled after a Shetland pony. Butterscotch also has built-in sensors all over her body, which enable her to respond to children in amazingly lifelike ways. If talked to, she will cock her head toward the speaker quizzically and blink her eyes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nShe will also react to petting, showing her enjoyment by rubbing her head against your child, twitching her ears, and swishing her tail. In addition to her convincing movements, Butterscotch also makes a medley of different sounds. She'll neigh and whinny just like a real pony, and snort when she wants attention. Should the room become dark, she will begin to whimper, letting her owner know that she needs a consoling hug to know that she is safe.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Saddle Up!</b><br>\r\nAt over three feet tall, Butterscotch is more than strong enough to support a rider up to 80 pounds in weight. Your little girl will be overjoyed to sit on Butterscotch's back and pretend to go for a ride. Although she doesn't move her legs, Butterscotch will bump up and down when her hindquarters are tapped, simulating the feeling of a real pony ride. She will also make clomping sounds with her hooves while riding. Your child's imagination will soar as she pictures herself out on the plains with Butterscotch.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Caring for Butterscotch</b><br>\r\nMuch like a real pony, Butterscotch loves to be groomed and fed. Children will keep very busy taking care of her. When given her special carrot, Butterscotch will chomp and munch on it. She also enjoys having her mane groomed with her brush. Along with her brush and carrot, Butterscotch comes with a special adoption certificate, which will give your little girl a real sense that Butterscotch belongs exclusively to her.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the Box</b><br><br>\r\nFurReal Friends Butterscotch Pony, carrot, brush, halter, and special adoption certificate.

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nGet ready to welcome a fun-loving furry friend into your house when you adopt Biscuit My Lovin Pup, one of the FurReal Friends by Hasbro. This oversized puppy responds to affectionate touches, voice commands, and motion with playful barks and realistic movements. Kids aged five and up are sure to love having a puppy of their very own.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Make a New Friend</b><br>\r\nThis oversized plush puppy has a soft coat and glossy, pleading eyes, just like a real dog. Get ready to start interpreting three different barks and a whole range of movements that are playful and affectionate. With a real collar, a bone-shaped treat to share, and a brush for smoothing out his silky fur, Biscuit is ready to settle into your house. He'll quickly start wagging his tail and making happy puppy noises. An adoption certificate is included to make kids feel like real pet owners.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBefore Biscuit is ready for a fun day with your child, an adult will need to use a Philips head screwdriver to install six \"D\" cell batteries (not included). The battery compartment is neatly hidden behind a Velcro closure on the pup's stomach.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Getting to Know Your Puppy</b><br>\r\nNine sensors allow Biscuit to respond when you pet him or issue a voice command. Kids will enjoy the contented sounds he makes when they pet his back and the discovery that if they hold a hand on his back he will lay down, if he is sitting, or sit up, if he is already laying down. Sensors in his nose and mouth prompt him to sniff when his nose is petted or chomp on his treat. Touch his left paw, and he will raise it to shake. A unique photo sensor in Biscuit's forehead prompts him to flinch, blink, or sneeze when you wave something in front of him.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTake a peek at the back of the bone-shaped tag on his collar to see all the commands he knows. You can ask him to \"sit,\" \"lie down,\" or \"speak.\" He even knows how to shake and will nod or move his paws in excitement when you ask, \"Do you want a treat?\" Like any voice recognition technology, Biscuit can be tricked by background noise or speech that is unclear. You may want to help younger children practice speaking the commands loudly, clearly, and distinctly, so they are not disappointed by his confusion.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Playing Options</b><br>\r\nBased on how much attention you are paying to him, Biscuit cycles through different modes. After a few moments of non-activation, Biscuit enters hangout mode. In this mode, he will move his head a little, whine, or bark to grab your attention. After a few minutes in hangout mode, he'll lay down and go to sleep. Thanks to his photo sensor, he will go to sleep faster in a darkened room. If the lights suddenly come on when he's been asleep in a dark room, he'll lift his head and make a mumbling noise.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile the noises he makes when moving betray his mechanical nature, this playful pup has an incredibly realistic look that is sure to have kids grooming him, offering him snacks, and engaging in imaginative play. With so many life-like responses and an irresistible puppy face, Biscuit really lived up to our expectations. His large size coupled with the weight of six \"D\" batteries could make it tricky for children to carry him around or travel with him, which means that when you head off on family adventures, he'll probably have to stay home, the same way a real dog often does.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the Box</b><br>\r\nPlush pup, collar, tag, plastic brush, plastic bone, and adoption certificate.

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nUltra-fierce and unbelievably fun, the D-REX Interactive Dinosaur is a cool, prehistoric creature with a personality all his own. Designed to keep kids eight and up entertained for days, this robotic D-REX moves, roars, and responds to your child's voice and touch. A bone-shaped controller even lets you \"train\" him as a guard dinosaur or an attack pet.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Get Ready for Realistic, Imaginative Fun</b>\r\nRight out of the box, this scaly pet D-REX feels more authentic than most other dinosaur toys on the market. His rubbery, reptilian skin is loosely stretched to accommodate movement, and he has a slightly strange texture that is soft to the touch. While his oversized feet and a fun spiked collar balance his menacing teeth and his darting yellow eyes, he is still a little scary looking. Don't worry--you'll soon discover that he has a sense of humor and a soft spot for anyone willing to scratch the back of his head.<br.<br>\r\n\r\nBefore you start getting to know D-REX personally, you'll need to use a Phillips screwdriver to insert five \"C\" batteries in his tail and two \"AAA\" batteries in the bone-shaped controller. Once he's powered up, D-REX is ready to start showing off and responding to his surroundings. He'll roar, turn his head, and blink his eyes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Cool Robotics Technology for Interactive Play</b>\r\nWhen you pet D-REX on the head, touch sensors let him respond with an appreciative roar. If he seems hungry, you can stick something in his mouth and he'll chomp away on it. And the bone-shaped controller lets you prompt five different types of behavior. Press \"attack,\" and he'll launch forward while roaring. Press \"prank,\" and he'll fart, burp, or roar. In seek mode, he uses a noise sensor to locate you and walk towards you. Due to the room's background noise, we found that he had some difficulty with this task. But it was funny (and kind of cute) when he bumped into walls and backed away in surprise.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps our favorite mode was \"guard.\" In this mode, you can set D-REX up in front of your bedroom door or your favorite toys and he will scan the room, letting out a big roar if he detects the motion of \"intruders.\" There's even a question mode that lets you replace your out-dated magic eight ball with dinosaur wisdom. Each time you press this button, D-REX will answer a question by nodding \"Yes\" or shaking his head \"No.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nD-REX is programmed to respond as a pet with an independent mind. This means that, despite his five-button remote, he won't walk where ever you want him to. Kids who expect to \"drive\" him around the room like a remote control car may be disappointed, but we actually enjoyed this fact a lot, since it made him more realistic. And we expect that kids who are fascinated by either dinosaurs or robotics will agree with us on this. As an added bonus, D'REX offers a battery-saving sleep mode, which parents are sure to appreciate.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the Box</b><br>\r\nD-REX Dinosaur and bone-shaped controller. "

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith games that reinforce skills like math and spelling, the LeapFrog DIDJ is a custom gaming system that parents won't mind seeing their children spending their afternoons with. Using your computer and the LEAPFROG Connect application, games can be customized to provide all kinds of learning opportunities for all kids between the ages of six to ten.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Making the DIDJ Your Own</b><br>\r\nBefore kids start creating, an adult will want to install four AA batteries (not included) in the DIDJ and set up the system. A convenient product guide pamphlet walks you through the necessary set-up tasks. This process involves installing the LEAPFROG Connect application onto your computer and transferring the included game, JetPack Heroes, onto the handheld DIDJ with a USB cable (included).<br><br>\r\n\r\nBefore you close the software down, kids will want to create their own custom avatars using the Didjerator. With a huge color palette to utilize, and the ability to make your avatar a robot with vampire fangs or dress it in a tuxedo with sneakers, it may take awhile to get each character perfect. Once this is done, the avatars can be downloaded to the handset and are available to play in any game that uses Didji characters.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Fun, Customizable Way to Learn</b><br>\r\nThe included game, JetPack Heroes, stars your favorite character in a fight against the villain Gooracha. Players use math skills to free the energy buddies they have captured and provide light and life for the entire planet. Quick fingers control the hero's jet pack and gun that is used to navigate the erratic landscape and stop enemy goons in between answering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdditional games that develop skills like vocabulary and spelling are available. One enticing feature of the interactive software is that points that are earned while playing, called Bitz, can be uploaded to your computer and then traded in for micromods, game updates such as new spaceships, backgrounds, or music.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Interactive Education</b><br>\r\nOverall, we had a great time creating our own characters and immersing ourselves in DIDJ worlds.

            "description": "<b>Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWii Fit is a combination of fitness and fun. By using Wii Fit a little every day, you, your friends, and your family can work towards personal goals of better health and fitness.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe active-play phenomenon started by Wii Sports now spreads to your whole body thanks to a pressure-sensitive Wii balance board, which comes packed with Wii Fit. The board is used for an extensive array of fun and dynamic activities, including aerobics, yoga, muscle stretches and games. Many of these activities focus towards providing a \"core\" workout, a popular exercise method that emphasizes slower, controlled motions. Family members will have fun staying active and talking about and comparing their results and progress on a new channel on the Wii Menu. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Body Test</b><br>\r\n\r\nDo a Body Test daily with the Wii Balance Board. In this test, you use the Wii Balance Board accessory to measure your center of balance, Body Mass Index (BMI), and body control. Based on these results, you can also determine your Wii Fit Age. Much like Brain Age, you can chart your daily progress and compare it to previous results, as well as other friends and family who play Wii Fit. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>All About Balance</b><br>\r\n\r\nYour center of balance, the point between your left and right sides when you are standing upright, has a lot to do with your health. Those without an even center of balance will be unnaturally compensating for this imbalance, which causes their posture to become misaligned, increasing the possibility of putting unnecessary strain on their bodies. Wii Fit can help you learn more about your balance, and give you tips on how to improve it. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>4 Training Modes</b><br>\r\n\r\nWii Fit features four main categories to choose from: Strength Training, Aerobics, Yoga, and Balance Games. From those groups, there are over 40 exercises and activities designed to improved body balance and fitness. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Wii Fit Channel</b><br>\r\n\r\nWith Wii Fit, you can install a channel in the Wii Menu so that you can perform a Body Test and view your graph without having to insert the Wii Fit disc everytime. For example, if you happen to have Super Mario Galaxy Game Disc in the Wii Console, you can still check your weight via the Wii Fit Channel without switching games. "

            "description": "<b>Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nGuitar Hero World Tour transforms music gaming by expanding Guitar Hero's signature guitar gameplay into a cooperative band experience that combines advanced wireless instruments with online and offline gameplay modes including online Band Career and 8-player \"Battle of the Bands,\" which allows two full bands to compete head-to-head online. The game features a slick redesigned guitar, an authentic electronic drum kit, and a microphone, as well as a Music Studio music creator that lets players compose, record, edit and share their own rock \u2018n\u2019 roll anthems.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Wireless Instruments</b><br>\r\nNew to GHWT is a redesigned, more responsive guitar controller, which features a touch-sensitive slide bar on the neck that allows the player to play through certain song passages without needing to strum. Check out the drum kit featuring three drum pads, two raised cymbals, and a bass kick pedal. The drum controller combines larger and quieter, velocity-sensitive drum heads with soft rubber construction to deliver authentic bounce back and is easy to set up, move, break down and store.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Be the Next Great Songwriter</b><br>\r\nMusic Studio lets players express their musical creativity by giving them access to a full complement of tools to create digital music from scratch utilizing the guitar controller and drum kit. Players can create their tracks and then play them in-game or share the recordings with the entire Guitar Hero community through GHTunes. GHTunes allows other gamers from around the world to download and play the community's original tracks. Available to Xbox 360 gamers is Line 6's guitar tone technology, enabling them to use amps, cabs, and effects from the Line 6 POD.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Create the Band</b><br>\r\nBudding rock stars can live out their rock \u2018n\u2019 roll fantasies by playing either a single instrument or any combination of instruments, in addition to the full band experience. When rocking as part of a band, up to four players can jam together in quickplay or as they progress through a career. Both band and single-player careers feature non-linear progression giving artists the option to change difficulty and instruments with a variety of different gigs available at any time.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Never Jam Solo Again</b><br>\r\nVirtual musicians in need of band mates can take their careers online forming worldwide ensembles so no rock star ever has to play a gig solo. Plus, GHWT adds a \"Battle of the Bands\" modes, which allows eight players to join online and challenge each other band-to-band to establish global supremacy.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Customize Everything</b><br>\r\nThe character creator allows gamers to create a rock star with style as unique as their own. Absolute customization from the clothes, to the facial and body structure, to the tattoos and accessories, players are encouraged to unleash their inner rock legend. The Rock Star Creator doesn't just allow players to build the ultimate rock god; the in-depth creators include the ability to customize guitars, drums and microphones. Adding yet another layer of personalization, gamers can create custom logos for their instruments, band, or album covers.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>A Set List for the Ages</b><br>\r\nThe Guitar Hero World Tour set list is comprised entirely of master recordings from some of the greatest artists of all-time including Van Halen, Linkin Park, The Eagles, and Sublime. There are over 85 tracks, plus frequent downloadable singles and track packs. In addition to the killer track list, the game will feature rock icons such as Hayley Williams of Paramore and Travis Barker of +44 and blink-182.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>In the box:</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nGame, Guitar, Microphone, Drums, and drum sticks.\r\n\r\n<b>If you win this item you must email customerservice@bidstick.com with the version you would like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nVersions available: </b><br>,br>\r\n\r\nWii<br>\r\nxbox 360<br>\r\nPS2<br>\r\nPS3\r\n"

It offers a full range of utility, decorative, quilting, heirloom, and stretch stitches, and thanks to each being electronically formed and optimally set, every stitch gets sewn with exact precision. The unit's automatic (but changeable) stitch settings, reverse stitching in the selected stitch pattern, and adjustable stitch length and width provide users with exceptional control over their projects. Even more, two styles of fully automatic one-step buttonholes ensure precisely balanced buttonholes, and the machine's free arm makes easy work of pant legs, cuffs, and sleeves. Other highlights include a built-in needle threader, a quick six-second threading system, either horizontal or vertical thread feed, automatic tension, and 13 needle positions, as well as automatic bobbin-winding, a clear bobbin cover for the top drop-in bobbin, on-board storage, and a long-lasting LED light to illuminate the working area. The machine comes with a full assortment of accessories including an instruction book, five snap-on presser feet (standard, zipper, buttonhole, blind-stitch, and satin-stitch/special-purpose), a feed cover, a pack of needles and bobbins, spool caps and pin, a screwdriver, and a seam ripper and lint brush.

The Lite-Flite isn't a big-league pitching machine, as it's designed to throw only Lite-Flite baseballs and 11- or 12-inch softballs or Jugs Bulldog baseballs and softballs. As a result, young hitters can learn how to hit sharp-breaking pitches without worrying about bruises or bone breaks. However, that doesn't mean the Lite-Flite won't prepare you for the bigs. The machine offers a full range of movement that adjusts for all types of pitches, including fastballs, curveballs, and sliders. In addition, you can adjust the swivel-design base casting 360 degrees to simulate fly balls, ground balls, and pop-ups--a must for fielders who want to practice defense in the backyard. And it doesn't matter which side of the plate you prefer, as the Lite-Flite throws both left- and right-handed pitches. "

The unit's wide path provides 20-percent more brushing and cleaning action, while its heated cleaning forces hot air from the motor directly into the carpet, making the solution and brushes work more efficiently. The cleaner's Dual V technology produces equal suction across the entire cleaning path and removes more water than any other brand. Patented SpinScrub rotating brushes gently loosen dirt and clean all sides of the carpet fiber, plus they pop out for rinsing clean as needed. Choose from three speeds for a variety of cleaning tasks--spill pick-up mode, gentle scrub mode, or power scrub mode. On-board tools include an 8-foot hose for long reach, a removable tool caddy for easy storage, and a SpinScrub powered handheld tool for upholstery and stairs.

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nDesigned for extra-large cats or multiple-cat households, this litter box actually cleans itself, depositing waste into the disposable container, which seals away the waste and odors. When the container is full, just throw it away and replace with a fresh one (replacements sold separately). The litter box's infrared sensor detects waste deposits and rakes them away 10 minutes after the cat leaves the litter box. If the cat re-enters and leaves the litter box before the initial 10 minutes have elapsed, the timer will automatically reset and delay the beginning of the cleaning cycle for an additional 10 minutes. The unit's safety bar automatically stops the cleaning rake at the slightest touch, and its paw-cleaning ramp traps litter when the cat exits the box. The steel rake can be removed and the litter tray detaches for easy cleaning. Other highlights include an \"on/off\" switch and indicator light, a sleep timer for nighttime use, and a sensor-activated ionic air cleaner to minimize odors between cycles. Accessories include four easy-to-install carbon filters and four disposable, sealable, waste receptacles for a virtually odor-free environment. The unit's quiet motor uses a low-voltage AC adapter (included) or batteries (8 standard \"AA\" batteries, which are not included). The litter box measures 28 by 20 by 8-1/2 inches. \r\n\r\n<b>includes:</b><br>\r\nLitter pan size: Elite Mega<br>\r\nWaster receptacles: 4<br>\r\nCarbon filters: 4<br>\r\nRamp<br>\r\nIonic air cleaner<br>\r\nSleep timer<br>\r\nRemovable rake<br>\r\nScoop<br>\r\nAC adaptor<br>\r\nOperates with batteries<br>\r\nUnit color: white<br>\r\nAccents: blue <br>"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\nBicycles are a terrific mode of transportation, but sometimes you just need a little extra push while getting around town. Enter the iZip Trailz women's electric comfort bike, which is equipped with a 450-watt DC earth magnet motor and a 24-volt rechargeable battery. Far cleaner than gas-powered scooters but zippier than a traditional bike, the Trailz will get you from point A to B in no time at all, but won't guzzle gas or belch pollutants in the process. The battery offers a range of 15 to 22 miles per charge, so you can make it back and forth to the grocery store several times without running low on power. And once you're on the road, the Trailz boasts a top speed of 15 miles per hour (contingent on the rider weight)--plenty fast enough for most bike-friendly city streets. Is your work commute too far to walk but close enough that a car seems wasteful? Turn to the Trailz, which comes with a rear rack to carry groceries and other gear."

No gardening experience or even dirt is necessary. It\u2019s a mess-free, user-friendly, low-maintenance process that you don\u2019t need a green thumb to use. About the size of an everyday coffee maker, the AeroGarden 3 Elite rests on your kitchen counter and fits into your d\u00e9cor. The AeroGarden 3 Elite uses NASA-tested aeroponic technology to grow plants in water, nutrients, and air. Aeroponics is a dirt-free growing method in which plant roots are suspended in air within a highly oxygenated growing chamber with 100% humidity. The roots are bathed in ideal levels of nutrients, oxygen, and water, allowing the plants to grow significantly faster, become healthier, and have a higher nutrient content that plants grown in soil. The Advanced Growing System with computerized Adaptive Growth Intelligence uses high-efficiency lighting and a quiet, low-maintenance chamber that provides more oxygen to the roots. All you have to do is add water, drop in the pre-seeded grow plugs, turn on the AeroGarden 3 Elite, and watch the plants grow in the 3 pods. The grow lights turn on and off automatically, and the computer reminds you via LCD display when to add water and nutrients. All plants are organically based and 100% natural. An English Garden Flowers Seed Kit and a grow bulb are included. The AeroGarden 3 Elite measures 20 x 9.5 x 11 inches and is covered by a 1-year warranty. \r\n"

Simply put, based on our independent testing and customer feedback, the EdgeStar AP14000W Portable Air Conditioner offers the perfect combination of cooling power, quality, and style for larger spaces. We recommend this dual hose portable air conditioner as the best choice for cooling rooms from 400 - 525 square feet.. Here are the primary reasons the EdgeStar Extreme Cool units are not only in a class of their own, but are also the most popular units we offer: Another great feature of this portable air conditioner is that it is an environmental friendly unit - It meets new RoHS standards. RoHS, also known as the lead-free directive, stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances.

The hub-style design, meanwhile, sets up quickly and efficiently, making this a great blind for on-the-go hunters. And thanks to the 12 shoot-through mesh windows and 360-degree viewing angles, you can see prey from hundreds of yards away. Other details include a Tangle camo pattern that blends beautifully into brush-filled environments, stakes for blustery days, and a carrying case for easy transport.

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith a timeless, inimitable overall design quality, this unique Breitling chronograph is certain to look just as fitting alongside a golf club and a freshly pressed polo shirt, or with a perfectly tailored three-button wool suit. Layered on a striking silver dial, sub-dials are found at the three, six, and nine o'clock positions, and a date window is featured at the four-thirty o'clock position. A blend of bold dashes and Arabic-numeral minutes act as indexes, and a rotating bezel with white highlights is included for added usability and style. Certain to turn heads while piloting your private jet or towing your neighbors behind the ski boat, the watch features large buttons just to the right of the case, and mechanical hand-wind movement is included for added appeal. A 22-millimeter contemporary stainless steel bracelet with matching 44-millimeter stainless steel case sets the stage for everything else. This Breitling watch, with a scratch-resistant sapphire dial window, is water resistant to 99 feet.\r\n\r\nAbout Breitling\r\nLouis Breitling founded his watch company in 1884 in St Imier, Switzerland with the specific purpose to develop chronographs and counters for scientific and industrial applications. In the early 19th century, Breitling expanded into creating high-quality timing instruments for automobiles and airplanes, beginning a long history of creating timing instruments for the aviation industry. In 1952, the Navitimer was launched, a wrist watch equipped with a so called \"navigation computer\" that allowed pilots to calculate flight plans. In 1962, the 24-hour Cosmonaute chronograph was released, and this watch was worn by Scott Carpenter when he flew America's second ever manned orbital flight in the Aurora 7.\r\n\r\nContinuing to innovate for professional flyers, in the mid-1990s Breitling introduced the Emergency, which features a built-in microtransmitter that broadcasts on the 121.5 MHz aircraft emergency frequency. This is used as a backup to airborne beacons, and its signal can be picked up within a range of up to 90 nautical miles. The Emergency has been put to the test on several occasions, most famously in rescuing two British pilots who crashed their helicopter in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nBreitling has also been at the forefront in advancing the mechanics of the chronograph timepiece. In 1923, it was the first watch manufacturer to introduce an independent push piece for the chronograph, enabling the start and return-to-zero function (previously performed by the winding-crown). Then in 1934, Breitling added a second push piece to the chronograph enabling either cumulative or incremental time recording. "

Featuring a five-stage filtration process, the RO incorporates sediment, coconut-shell carbon, and reverse osmosis technologies to provide great-tasting, bottled-quality water straight from your tap.\r\n\r\nOther Products\r\nYou May Want to Consider:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll-in-One Water Test Kit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Faucet with Air Gap, Brushed Stainless Steel\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Filtration Booster Pump Kit\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-stage filtration and reverse osmosis provide cleaner water straight from the tap.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the lifecycle of a single filter, you can save up to 16,000 plastic bottles from being deposited in landfills.\r\nFive-Stage Filtration Removes Contaminants\r\nThe Watts RO filters in five stages to ensure that your drinking water is as healthy and clean as possible. Once the system is connected, water passes through a 5-micron sediment filter that traps particulate matter--such as dirt, rust, and silt--that can affect the taste and appearance of your water. Next, a 5-micron carbon block filter reduces chlorine taste and odor, as well as other materials that can give water a bad taste. For the third stage, another 5-micron carbon block filter further reduces chlorine, as well as difficult-to-remove chloramines.\r\n\r\nReverse Osmosis for High-Quality Drinking Water\r\nThe system's fourth stage of filtration is especially important, as it involves the passage of water through the reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. This semi-permeable membrane effectively removes arsenic, lead, perchlorate, chromium, copper, TDS (total dissolved solids), sodium, and a long list of other water contaminants. It also removes parasytic cysts, such as giardia and cryptosporidia.\r\n\r\nThe fifth stage of filtration utilizes a high quality GAC filter, which works as a final polishing filter when the water leaves the storage tank on its way up to your faucet. The end result is consistently great-tasting water at just pennies per gallon.\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Drinking Clean Water\r\nWater is critical to proper food digestion, kidney health, brain function, blood health, joint functionality, and more. It's important to make sure that the water you drink is devoid of contaminants. Thankfully, using a Watts water filtration device will ensure consistent quality for all of your drinking and cooking needs. In fact, when you use Watts' high-quality certified water treatment devices and filters, your water will be free of chlorine taste and odors, particles, and many other contaminants that can be detrimental to your health.\r\n\r\n*Please refer to the Performance Data Sheet for the complete list of claims for which this system is certified.\r\n\r\nAn Eco-Friendly Choice\r\nNot only is the RO filter a healthy choice for you, but it's also a healthy choice for the environment. This filter helps you minimize the harmful environmental consequences of buying bottled water. Incredibly, if a mere ten percent of North America's bottled water intake were reduced by switching to home-filtered water in reusable containers, we could eliminate:\r\n\r\n133,000 trucks driving an average of 500 miles--saving nearly 12 million gallons of diesel fuel\r\nOver 100 million pounds of greenhouse gasses--equal to taking 1,100 cars off the road annually\r\n213 million pounds of PET--equal to 1.5 million barrels of crude oil or improving the PET recycling rate by 10%\r\nDepending upon which Watts water-filtration product you use, you can prevent up to 16,000 half-liter bottles from being deposited in landfills--all in the time it takes to use and replace a single filter.\r\n\r\nThe Watts Premier Five Stage Reverse Osmosis Water Filtration Device is backed by a three-year limited warranty.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\nFive-Stage Reverse Osmosis Module (complete with filters), parts bag (with a 10-inch final filter), 3-gallon storage tank, faucet assembly, and manual.\r\n\r\n"

It's powered by a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which includes an amazingly fast 1066 MHz front-side bus speed and super-sized 6 MB L2 cache. This dual-core processor also provides an optimized, multithreaded architecture for improved multitasking, video, and gaming performance. And this iMac also gets a boost in video processing power from the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics chip with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory.\r\n\r\nDesigned with a recyclable anodized aluminum frame and glass cover, the iMac is friendlier to the environment.\r\nThe iMac also features an ultra-thin aluminum Apple Keyboard--with dedicated keys for Mac features such as brightness, volume, eject, play/pause, and Expos\u00e9--as well as the wired Mighty Mouse. It's pre-loaded with Apple's Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system, which enables easy backup of your most important data via Time Machine, a redesigned desktop that helps eliminate clutter. It also comes with the iLife '09 suite of applications--including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes--and the newest version of the fast-loading Safari web browser.\r\n\r\nHardware features include a 640 GB hard drive, 4 GB of RAM (with an 8 GB maximum capacity), 8x SuperDrive for burning movies to DVD and music mixes to CD, integrated 802.11n wireless LAN, Gigabit Ethernet wired networking, and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR connectivity.\r\n\r\nPower on a Pedestal\r\nWith its anodized aluminum frame set upon a sleek pedestal, the new iMac instantly transforms your workspace from cluttered desktop to brilliant display podium. Because the iMac's housing is made from a single sheet of aluminum, you won't see any seams or screws except for a single compartment on the bottom that provides easy access to the memory slots. The glossy widescreen 24-inch glass display makes photos and movies come alive with rich color. And the built-in iSight camera and microphone are integrated so neatly you barely notice they're there. Aside from the design details, the iMac is also friendlier to the environment with highly recyclable and durable materials including scratch-resistant glass and professional grade aluminum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compact keyboard's ultrathin anodized aluminum enclosure features low-profile keys that provide a crisp, responsive feel.\r\nWith its elegant anodized aluminum enclosure, the new Apple Keyboard looks equally at home in your living room or on your desk. Just connect it to the USB port on your iMac and start enjoying the crisp, responsive feel of its low-profile keys. This compact keyboard also includes special function keys for Mac features such as brightness, volume, eject, play/pause, Expos\u00e9, and more. Two USB 2.0 ports provide high-speed connectivity for your iPod, Mighty Mouse, digital camera, and other USB-based electronic devices.\r\n\r\nIntel Core 2 Duo Processor\r\nExperience faster, more nimble application performance and improved energy efficiency with this 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor. Its hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--helps to reduce power consumption while delivering. powerful processing speeds. This 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo processor is aided by a 1066 front-side bus speed and a super-sized 6 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system's performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)\r\n\r\nThe Intel Core 2 Duo's 128-bit SSE3 vector engine handles 128-bit computations in a single clock cycle, accelerating data manipulation by simultaneously applying a single instruction to multiple data. And its two execution cores are designed to share resources and conserve power, helping it to achieve higher levels of performance since it uses fewer watts.\r\n\r\nHard Drive and Memory\r\nThe 640 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (7200 RPM) quickens the pace with a higher speed transfer of data--akin to FireWire and USB 2.0. The 4 GB of DDR3 RAM (two SO-DIMMs of 2 GB) have an industry leading 1066 MHz speed, and the RAM capacity can be increased to 8 GB.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Video\r\nThe 24-inch widescreen TFT active-matrix LCD offers a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels. It has a brightness rating of 385 cd/m2 (candela per square meter), a contrast ratio of 750:1, and a viewing angle of 160 degrees (both horizontal and vertical). The NVIDIA GeForce 9400M shares 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM with main memory. You'll notice the difference when you work with high-resolution photos and high-definition video, where graphics-intensive features in iPhoto and iMovie are smoother. And 3D game play--from Spore to Call of Duty--is faster and more responsive.\r\n\r\nThis iMac also enables you to connect a second display in either extended desktop mode or video mirroring mode. The Mini DisplayPort port offers support for DVI, dual-link DVI, and VGA video connections via an optional adapter.\r\n\r\nWired and Wireless Connectivity\r\nThe iMac gives you plenty of room to grow, accommodating as many as six peripherals at a time thanks to its four USB 2.0 ports and the two USB 2.0 ports on the Apple Keyboard. It also includes a single powered FireWire 800 port (one of the fastest peripheral standards available)--enabling you to quickly transfer content from compatible digital video cameras, hard drives, and other high-speed devices.\r\n\r\nShare files around your house with built-in 10/100/1000BASE-T Ethernet as well as the next-generation high-speed wireless 802.11n technology, which is integrated into the latest Apple Airport Extreme Base Station. The iMac is also Wi-Fi Certified to work with base stations and routers that use industry-standard 802.11a, 802.11b, or 802.11g wireless technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou get a full complement of ports on the back of the iMac, including four USB 2.0 and one Firewire 800.\r\nThe integrated Bluetooth wireless connectivity--version 2.1 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)--allows you to use a wireless keyboard or mouse, and synchronize peripherals such as cell phones and PDAs. Enjoy high-quality sound on almost any speaker system with double-duty analog/digital audio. Record digital and analog sources through audio line in, perfect for your latest podcast in GarageBand.\r\n\r\nSuperDrive\r\nIntegrated neatly into the iMac is a slot-loading SuperDrive that lets you play and burn your own CDs and DVDs--including double-layer DVDs. And there's no disc tray--just slide the disc right in. It offers the following speeds:\r\n\r\n    * Writes DVD+R DL and DVD-R DL discs at up to 4x speed\r\n    * Writes DVD-R and DVD+R discs at up to 8x speed\r\n    * Writes DVD-RW at up to 6x speed and DVD+RW discs at up to 8x speed\r\n    * Reads DVDs at up to 8x speed\r\n    * Writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed\r\n    * Writes CD-RW discs at up to 16x speed\r\n    * Reads CDs at up to 24x speed \r\n\r\nOther Features\r\n\r\n    * Built-in stereo speakers with internal 24-watt digital amplifier\r\n    * Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to a 30-inch display (2560 by 1600 pixels) on an external display\r\n    * Headphone/optical digital audio output (minijack)\r\n    * Audio line in/optical digital audio input (minijack)\r\n    * Built-in microphone\r\n    * Dimensions: 22.4 x 20.5 x 8.1 inches (WxHxD)\r\n    * Weight: 25.4 pounds \r\n\r\nThe Greenest iMac Yet\r\nThe energy-efficient hardware components in the iMac work hand in hand with Mac OS X to create a system that can dynamically adjust power consumption to reduce the energy used overall. The iMac uses an advanced power management system leveraged from the technology that makes the most of battery life in Apple's MacBook family. To reduce energy consumption, the iMac hard drive spins down automatically when inactive, and it also decides which processor--CPU or GPU--is best suited to perform a task efficiently. That means when iMac is idle, it's using as little power as possible.\r\n\r\nApple engineers have worked hard to eliminate many of the toxins that are a common part of desktop computer manufacturing, such as choosing arsenic-free display glass for iMac. They have also removed brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from circuit boards, internal cables, connectors, insulators, adhesives, and more. And the entire iMac computer is integrated into an enclosure made from a single, solid piece of recyclable aluminum, while the display is made of recyclable glass.\r\n\r\nThe Mac mini meets the stringent low power requirements set by the EPA, giving it ENERGY STAR certification. In addition, Mac mini meets the latest efficiency requirements of ENERGY STAR Version 5.0 Specification for Computers before its July 2009 effective date. It has also earned the highest rating of EPEAT Gold. The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or EPEAT, evaluates the environmental impact of a product based on how recyclable it is, how much energy it uses, and how it's designed and manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreloaded with Leopard, you'll enjoy enhanced productivity and a clutter-free desktop (thanks to the the redesigned 3D Dock with Stacks).\r\nPreloaded with Leopard and iLife '09\r\nThe biggest Mac OS X upgrade ever, the Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system features over 300 new features, including:\r\n\r\n    * Time Machine, an effortless way to automatically back up everything on a Mac\r\n    * A redesigned Finder that lets users quickly browse and share files between multiple Macs\r\n    * Quick Look, a new way to instantly see files without opening an application\r\n    * Spaces, an intuitive new feature used to create groups of applications and instantly switch between them\r\n    * A brand new desktop with Stacks, a new way to easily access files from the Dock\r\n    * Major enhancements to Mail and iChat \r\n\r\nLeopard's new desktop includes the redesigned 3D Dock with Stacks, a new way to organize files for quick and easy access with just one click.

When they woke up the next morning, they were married and pregnant. The offspring from that evening now takes the form of wunderboxes like the Firebird 803. The progeny of two very talented parents, this PC is one of the smartest rigs we\u2019ve tested. Here\u2019s what reviewer Chris Null had to say:\r\n\r\n    HP and its boutique/luxe division Voodoo deserve serious praise for what they\u2019ve accomplished with the Firebird 803. Taking a mix of laptop and desktop guts, juicing it up with high-end components, cooling it with liquid goo instead of noisy fans, and encasing it inside a gorgeous, curvy shell that would make most industrial designers weep with envy, the Firebird is a testament to how the envelope can be pushed in the typically boring PC world. \r\n"

            "description": "<b>Product Description</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOriginally broadcast on CBS in March 2002, 9/11 is an extraordinary record of that fateful day in New York City. This one-of-a-kind documentary was originally conceived as a portrait of 21-year-old Tony Benetatos, a firefighter trainee at Manhattan's Duane Street firehouse, located seven blocks from the World Trade Center. By the time filming was finished, brothers Jules and Gedeon Naudet had captured history in the making, including the only image of the first jetliner striking Tower 1, and the only footage from within the tower as it collapsed. This is not, however, a film about the murderous nightmare of terrorism. It's the ultimate rite-of-passage drama, more immediate and meaningful than any fiction film could be, with Benetatos and his supportive colleagues emerging as heroes of the first order. Sensitively narrated by codirector and fellow firefighter James Hanlon, 9/11 will endure forever as a tribute to those, living and dead, who witnessed hell on that sunny Tuesday morning. --Jeff Shannon\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nThis heartfelt documentary was created and personally supervised by the award-winning french filmmakers jules & gedeon naudet who simply set out to make a movie about a rookie new york city fireman from engine 7 ladder 1 and ended up filming an event that changed our lives forever.

Dyson proves no loss of suction, best average pick up, and the claim \"overall outcleans other vacuums\" using results from IEC60312 Cl 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 2.9,  ASTM F608 and F558, and DTM 755--an independently conducted Dyson test. Effective for use on all floor types, the unit's motorized brushbar can be turned on to remove dirt and pet hair from carpets, or turned off to protect rugs and delicate floors. The vacuum cleaner also comes equipped with a quick-draw Telescope reach; the wand releases and expands 16-feet at the touch of a button for stairs and high-reach cleaning. In addition, the unit's advanced mini turbine head cleans pet hair from confined spaces such as upholstery, stairs, and the car, and its low-reach floor tool attaches to the wand to clean hard-to-reach places such as under beds and sofas.\r\n\r\nThoughtfully designed, the unit's hygienic 5/8-gallon bin quickly empties without ever having to touch the dust--simply pull the trigger. The clear bin means no bags to buy, plus it allows for easily viewing the cleaning progress and gauging when it's full. Air expelled from the unit contains up to 150 times less mold and bacteria than common breathing air thanks to the vacuum's money-saving, lifetime HEPA filter. Furthermore, Dyson upright vacuums are the first and only vacuums certified asthma friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation. Other highlights include 220 air watts, auto carpet-height adjustment, a 35-foot cord, on-board tool storage, and an ergonomic design with a low handle that feels lighter to carry. The included carpet-care kit helps keep new carpets looking new. The Zorb powder absorbs dirt from carpets; the Dyzolve spray removes spills and marks. The durably built vacuum cleaner measures 26-2/3 by 13-1/5 by 43-1/2 inches and carries a five-year warranty.\r\n"

            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nay tribute to your favorite Major League Baseball player with this official name and number T-shirt. Made of 100-percent cotton, the shirt is soft and comfortable, with a screen-printed team name on the front and the player's name and number on the back. And as with every Majestic garment, the shirt carries itself with the same qualities--commitment, tenacity, and persistence--as every Major Leaguer who's ever stolen home, thrown a 100 mph fastball, or batted in the winning run. Available in the official team color, the machine-washable T-shirt is officially licensed by Major League Baseball.\r\nAbout Majestic Athletic\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Majestic Athletic story began in the 1950s, when Mary Capobianco endeavored to open her own sewing mill. After working in the booming garment industry of Bangor, Pennsylvania, she realized she could work just as hard for herself and get much more in return. She started with women's clothing, blouses mostly. The company was called Maria Rose Fashions, and served well-dressed women from coast to coast. It was a far cry from athletic apparel, but it demanded the same attention to detail.\r\n\r\nAfter learning the garment business first-hand, her son Faust Capobianco, III, followed in her footsteps. In 1976, he founded the Majestic Athletic you know today. Well, almost. The spirit was there, but the company hadn't made it to the big leagues yet. That happened in 1982, when Majestic introduced their first Major League Baseball batting practice jersey. This relationship grew in 1984 when the company signed their first MLB National Licensing Agreement, which brought fans the high-quality apparel they needed to truly show their team's colors.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning, Majestic Athletic's philosophy has been simple: create the highest-quality athletic wear with a commitment to heritage, craftsmanship, and authenticity. And even though the company hit the big leagues, they still take time to add the hand-stitched details that got them where they are. But now they do it for every Major League Baseball club, the National Basketball Association, National Pro Fastpitch Softball, most major colleges and universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe P-51 is an American single seat fighter aircraft that fought alongside the allied air forces during World War II, becoming one of the most successful and recognized World War II airplanes. Used as a bomber escort, most P-51 took place over Germany, as the Allied forces battled over the airspace. In addition to being an agile fighter, the Mustang was incredibly fast, with a version powered by a stage two, two speed supercharged 12-cylinder engine. After the conflict, many P-51 were converted into race planes, earning such a reputation that one of Ford Motor Company's chief designers proposed the Mustang name for one of its sports coupes. With its semi-scale appearance, powerful gearbox driven 370 motor and stable flight characteristics, the P-51 Mustang provides plenty of aerobatic fun. This almost-ready-to-fly injected molded foam airplane can be assembled to fly in under an hour."

            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nGarmin's nuvi 260W combines the thinprofile and attractive price point of other nuvi 200-series GPS with directions in real street names and a wide screen that lets you see more of what's around you as you drive. Garmin's line on the device is that, \"the nuvi 260W gives consumers the most sought-after navigation features, while eliminating many of the premium add-ons. The result is a PND that simply gets you from point A to point B \u2013 reliably, efficiently, and with style.\" As with all n\u00fcvis, you get Garmin reliability, the fast satellite lock of a high-sensitivity integrated receiver, a slim, pocket-sized navigator with a gorgeous display, detailed NAVTEQ maps that lets  you search by name for more than 6 million points of interest like stores, restaurants or hospitals, and an easy, intuitive interface.\r\n\r\nThe text-to-speech feature of the nuvi 260W means that device automatically calls out street names (saying \"turn right on Main Street\" instead of \"turn right in 200 feet.\"). This feature lets drivers keep their eyes on the road while navigating through busy traffic and tricky roadways.\r\nSee More of What's Around\r\nThe 4.3-inch backlit widescreen touchscreen on the nuvi 260W gives you 70% more actual screen area than a 3.5-inch screen. Primarily this translates into a better view of the area through which you are driving. This is especially useful in showing you what parks, restaurants, ATM, gas stations, etc. are nearby, or in letting you know whether a detour is a good idea. Also, the device itself is larger, meaning controls on the screen are more widely spaced and somewhat easier to push.\r\n\r\nSmart, Powerful Design\r\nThe nuvi 260W is built with a high-sensitivity GPS receiver for extreme accuracy, as well as an SD card slot for storing your media and additional navigation tools, and a USB interface for loading data. All this is wrapped up in a package that measures 4.8 x 2.9 x 0.8 inches (W x H x D) and weighs just 6.6 ounces. The nuvi display is touchscreen-enabled, making it a cinch to control the device with your fingertips. A rechargeable lithium-ion battery provides up to five hours of battery life depending on use.\r\n\r\nGarmin Lock\r\nGarmin's patent pending theft prevention system that disables the unit from performing any functions until the user types in a specific 4-digit PIN or takes the unit to a predetermined secure location\r\n\r\nFirst Rate Map Data\r\nThe n\u00fcvi 260W comes ready to go right out of the box with preloaded City Navigator NT street maps, including a hefty POI database with hotels, restaurants, fuel, ATMs and more. Simply touch the color screen to enter a destination, and n\u00fcvi takes you there with 2D or 3D maps and turn-by-turn voice directions. Garmin gets its map data from NAVTEQ, a world leader in premium-quality mapping.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the nuvi 260W accepts custom points of interest (POIs), such as school zones and safety cameras and lets you set proximity alerts to warn you of upcoming POIs\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy To Use Interface\r\nGarmin's interface is a key to their success and one of the things that makes their devices such a pleasure to use. Simple controls and sub-screens make it easy to enter or search for destinations and get data about your trip."

The classic European design is an adaptation of a vintage pattern first introduced by the company circa 1876, and the clean, elegant style still makes an impressive statement at tables today. Crafted from heavy-gauge 18/10 stainless steel--18 percent chrome for corrosion resistance and 10 percent nickel for luster--the continentally sized flatware features a substantial handle flaring from the banded neck to the softly rounded tip. A delicate line design traces the border with a few simple curves and curlicues to add visual interest, and the mirror-polish finish give the pattern a lustrous gleam. True to Henckels' history as a fine knife maker, the dinner knife offers superior balance in the hand and has a forged blade for sharp, precise cuts.\r\nThis 23-piece set provides service for four plus three serving pieces. Each five-piece place setting includes a salad fork, a dinner fork, a dinner knife, a soupspoon, and a teaspoon. The service set includes a serving spoon, a meat fork, and a butter knife. The set goes safely into the dishwasher for easy cleanup.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\r\n4 place settings, 3 serving pieces. Each place setting consists of: salad fork; dinner fork; dinner knife; soupspoon; teaspoon.

            "description": "The Flip Ultra HD isn\u2019t heavy on features, but given its small and slender size it does pack a reasonable punch.  Total recording time of the camcorder is 2 hours in a 720p resolution.  You can review the recorded footage on the 2-inch (960\u00d7240) LCD screen, which also includes a built-in speaker, or plug it into your TV via the HDMI output.  I would have liked to see a headphone jack, but then again the mic isn\u2019t exactly high fidelity but most certainly sufficed given the type of scenarios I used the camera in. What\u2019s especially nifty about the Flip camcorders is the built-in USB plug that flips out with the flick of a switch.  This pretty much means you can transfer footage to any computer at any time as well as charge the device.  This proved to be a god send last night when I was at a BBQ and suddenly realized I was running low on juice.\r\n\r\nSo who would have thought that a remote sized camcorder would have been able to shoot HD video.  Check the video clips below for a true testament to the Flip Ultra HD\u2019s quality, but shooting video with the camcorder couldn\u2019t have been any easier thanks to its simple button configuration -  any newb can use it right out of the box.  Smack center on the back of the device is a big old red button, which clearly denotes the rec start/stop button.  It\u2019s surrounded by a navigation pad that is used to scroll through recorded videos, increase/decrease digital zoom and increase/decrease the Flip\u2019s speaker volume.  Just below the lens is a red light that denotes when it is recording, but this can be disabled in the setup menu (initial startup prompts you with this menu where you can also setup the time stamp and date) assuming you don\u2019t want your \u2018actors\u2019 to know your recording.\r\n\r\nThe Flip Ultra HD is no doubt pocket sized and light weight, but with that comes some sacrifices, such as an optical zoom and the ability to pull focus.  The Flip Ultra HD also lacks an AC charger, which means that you\u2019ll either have to use your iPhone charger or find a nearby computer to power up the device.  Fortunately, the battery life is reasonable but not totally stellar.  After 1 hour of continuous recording the Flip UltraHD\u2019s batteries were fully drained, but an almost full charge took about the same amount of time (this is contrary to Flip\u2019s specs so it might be safe to assume I had a bunk battery).  The Flip comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and since they they\u2019re essentially 2 AAs, you could very well pop in any AA battery when in a pinch.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll let the below videos do most of the talking, but as you\u2019ll see the UltraHD can produce solid 720 HD video and is well suited for the likes of YouTube and other video sites of the same ilk.  Unfortunately, and as you\u2019ll also see, the UltraHD is sensitive to vibration since it lacks an optical image stabilizer and has a tendency to produce distorted images when panning or titling the camera quickly.  Lastly, the UltraHD is capable of recording in low light situations but given its rather small optics will result in a rather noise heavy image.\r\n\r\nThe Flip UltraHD is by all accounts a steal.  It\u2019s small form factor, ease of use and ability to capture 720 HD video makes it a serious contender for a place in the family camcorder category.  Although quick pan and tilt maneuvers lead to a slightly distrorted image (see some of the videos), this draw back and its other lacking features can easily be overlooked in light of its low price tag ($200) and super ease of use.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nHigh Def video\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n\r\nRechargeable batteries work out the box & AA batteries\r\n\r\nBuilt-in USB plug\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1 hour battery life\r\n\r\nDistorted images when panning too fast\r\n\r\nNo optical zoom or any manual controls\r\n\r\nNo external charger"

            "description": "Not only does the HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor utilize Omron's patented IntelliSense technology, but it also features the innovative Comfit Cuff. The ComFit Cuff is pre-formed for a quick and proper fit that is perfect for both medium and large-sized arms (nine to 17 inches). It's easy to apply the cuff to your arm without any assistance -- simply wrap the cuff around your arm and press start. In seconds your blood pressure and pulse are displayed on the large digital panel. Proven time and time again, Omron's IntelliSense technology ensures accurate, clinically-proven, and comfortable readings. And with a 90-memory recall with date and time stamp, you can track your blood pressure and pulse progress as your work towards a healthier lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWhat is IntelliSense?\r\n\r\nThe IntelliSense monitor inflates the cuff to the ideal level with each use -- you never have to make any adjustments to select an inflation level. This is especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders because their blood pressure is so likely to fluctuate. The biggest advantage of using the IntelliSense technology is a personalized inflation every time for maximum comfort.\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring\r\nDoctors, diabetes educators, physician assistants, nurses, and other healthcare professionals all recommend home blood pressure monitoring for various reasons. Home monitoring provides your healthcare professionals with better information to understand and manage your high blood pressure. Many types of hypertension can only be detected by monitoring your blood pressure at home, including:\r\n\r\nWhite-Coat Hypertension: blood pressure reading is high in your doctor's office but lower at home\r\n\r\nMasked Hypertension: blood pressure reading is low in doctor's office but higher at home\r\n\r\nMorning Hypertension: blood pressure reading is higher in the morning\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many factors can affect your blood pressure, including physical exertion, emotional fluctuations, medications, and stress. So having your blood pressure monitored at a pharmacy with an in-store device after you've been shopping or walking around might not provide you with the most accurate measurement. Monitoring your blood pressure at home allows you achieve a relaxed state more easily, and it gives you the flexibility to take your measurements at various times during the day. By keeping track of your home blood pressure readings, you can provide your healthcare professional with a log of your measurements over time. This can help them evaluate the effectiveness or need for medication.\r\n\r\nProduct Features:\r\n\r\nCleared by the FDA to help detect morning hypertension\r\n\r\nIntelliSense monitor inflates cuff to the ideal level with each use\r\n\r\nLarge digital panel displays blood pressure and pulse readings\r\n\r\nCuff fits arms 9 to 17 inches in circumference\r\n\r\nMain unit measures 5.16 x 3.31 x 6.09 inches (WxHxD)\r\n\r\n"

A DSLR delivers incredible image quality, but most aren\u2019t compact enough to roam with you. Now, the E-P1 changes the game with a compact body that delivers the professional quality images of a DSLR without the bulk. Moreover, its sharp HD video capture and stereo audio helps you live a better-documented life because you\u2019re carrying one portable camera rather than a DSLR, an HD camcorder and a high-end audio device. \r\n\r\nYou can share more of your life with the world when the E-P1 travels with you. Make your Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter and personal blog postings unique by capturing and sharing more videos and photos. You can chronicle more of the life you actually lead, rather than just special occasions you prepare for, like weddings, holidays and birthday parties. Since it\u2019s the only camera to offer in-camera art filters for both still photography and videos with high-end audio, even your everyday activities will look and sound amazing! \r\n\r\nBeautifully Designed Stainless-Steel Body\r\nThe new camera\u2019s high-end, stainless-steel body is easy to handle and carry, and has the styling and refinement of a precision watch. Its retro-chic look turns heads, from tech aficionados and camera buffs to the fashion-conscious and everyday point-and-shooter. Built to be solid, it fits comfortably in a jacket pocket or a handbag for a night on the town, or to take on any spontaneous adventure. The E-P1 lets you do more and go more places while capturing your life, thanks to its compact size--4.75 x 2.75 x 1.43 inches (W x H x D)--and light 11.8-ounce body. Attention to detail is visible in every aspect of the camera\u2019s retro-style metal body design, available in either silver or white with accompanying new small and lightweight Olympus M. ZUIKO Micro Four Thirds lenses: 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 (28-84mm equivalent) and 17mm f2.8 (34mm equivalent). \r\n"

            "description": "Designed to allow more people to experience a taste of touch technology at an attractive price, the LG KP500 Cookie is packed full of advanced features usually found exclusively in premium full touchscreen handsets. Its easily accessible multimedia features--available through widgets as well as shortcut icons--provide a fun and easy mobile experience with a single touch of its 3.0-inch screen. It comes with a stylus that tucks away in the back of the phone and features easy-to-use handwriting recognition.\r\n\r\nYou'll be able to capture still photos and video clips on the go thanks to the 3.2-megapixel camera, as well as enjoy advanced gaming thanks to the touchscreen and the Cookie's motion sensor technology. Other features include Bluetooth connectivity for handsfree devices and stereo music streaming, MicroSD memory expansion, digital audio player, stereo FM with RDS capabilities, access to personal email with a document viewer, and up to 3.5 hours of talk time.\r\n\r\nUnlocked Phone\r\nThis unlocked cell phone can be used with a GSM network service provider and it provides quad-band connectivity (850/900/1800/1900 MHz).

The Home screen menu from LG's Flash user interface (UI) provides quick access to your calendar, alarm clock and digital audio player. The optimized QWERTY keyboard, which automatically comes out when the screen is in wide display mode, enables fast and easy input for email and text-messaging.\r\n\r\nWith the Cookie's handwriting recognition, you can write and draw on messages or background pictures taken with the phone's camera, as well as send text messages without even using the virtual keyboard. It's also great for realistic gameplay thanks to the embedded motion sensor technology, which recognizes your hand movements and reflects them in the game itself\r\n\r\nThe Cookie includes a small 48 MB internal memory, which can be expanded via optional MicroSD memory cards up to 8 GB in size. The internal phonebook can store up to 1000 contact entries (each with 15 fields for storing multiple numbers, email addresses, IM handles, and more), as well as up to 500 text messages, 500 memos, and 500 to-do items.

And with the embedded A2DP Bluetooth profile, you can stream your music to a pair of Bluetooth stereo headphones or other compatible devices.\r\n\r\nThe 3.2-megapixel camera offers six resolution options (320x240 / 400x240 / 640x480 / 1280x960 / 1600x1200 / 2048x1536) as well as a 2x digital zoom.

In addition to still photos, the Cookie can capture video clips in two resolution options (176x144 / 320x240, 12 fps).\r\n\r\nThe digital media player offers wide compatibility for audio (MP3, AAC, AAC+, WMA, RA) and video (MPEG4/H.263), and it features equalizer pre-sets (Classic, jazz, Pop, Rock, Concert hall). It also includes a built-in FM radio with RDS, which displays the name of the currently playing song (when tuned to compatible radio stations).\r\n\r\nOther features include:\r\n\r\nMessaging: SMS, EMS, MMS, Email\r\n\r\nDocument viewer: MS Office, Doc, PDF\r\n\r\nEmbedded applications and games: Data Wallet, Pipe, Wheelmania, Flying Dices, Thomsons & Touch\r\n\r\nOrganizer tools: Calendar, memo, to-do, world clock, unit converter, calculator, alarm, stopwatch\r\n\r\nUSB 2.0 connectivity\r\n\r\nSpeakerphone, voice memo recording\r\n\r\nWeb browser (WAP 2.0/xHTML)\r\n\r\nFlight mode\r\n\r\nVital Statistics\r\n\r\nThe LG Cookie weighs 3.14 ounces and measures 4.19 x 2.18 x 0.47 inches.

            "description": "When the Motorola RAZR V3 was launched last year, I think most everybody, including Motorola itself, was quite surprised by how popular the handset turned out to be, considering the asking price. Its slim profile and sleek silver colored metal body proved to be just too much of a temptation for the world, and people the world over jumped through hoops and over hurdles just to get one for their very own. Everybody was a movie star with one of these!\r\n\r\nUntil, of course, Motorola gave 50 exclusive RAZR V3 BLK handsets to some real movie stars at the 77th Annual Academy Awards in February, 2005. All of a sudden, the silver RAZR lost some of its shine. But once again, it is time for the masses to rejoice. Motorola is making the RAZR BLK available to all.\r\n\r\nOf course it isn't just the color that makes the RAZR V3 BLK such a desirable handset. One reason that people love it so is its size. It weighs only 3.35oz (95g), which is pretty light for a phone that has a largely metal body. At 3.86\" x 2.17\" x .57\" (98mm x 55mm x 14.5mm) in size, it is actually thinner than most candy bar style phones on the market. It can be slipped perfectly into a shirt, suit, or pants pocket, as well as a purse, without being noticed.\r\n\r\nThere is so much more to the RAZR V3 BLK than its physical being, though. Certainly the primary purpose of any phone must be making phone calls, and in spite of its small stature, the RAZR V3 BLK managed a full 7 hours of talk time in our tests - a very respectable showing. A related bonus is the fact that you can charge the RAZR V3 BLK directly from your computer's USB port with the same type of mini-USB cable that you probably already have for your digital camera. That's one less power adapter to pack in the suitcase. Support for all 4 GSM frequency bands means that the RAZR will work in San Francisco and New York just as well as it will in Paris and London. The handset's internal antenna also proved to be quite capable, offering up very good reception in weak signal areas.\r\n\r\nOf course some compromises had to be made to get all of this functionality into such a small package. The keypad, for example, is a very thin metal unit that offers less tactile feedback than most, though it makes up for that somewhat by looking fantastic in the dark, thanks to its cool blue back light. While quite usable, it might take a bit of getting used to. No compromises were made with the main display, though: a nice 2.2\" 65k color TFT unit, with 176 x 220 pixel resolution. The external display is also color, though only a 4k CSTN type.\r\n\r\nThe built-in VGA camera proved itself to be one of the better ones on the market, offering good contrast, color, and focus in most situations. The RAZR's polyphonic sound system also works quite well, and even allows you to use MP3 files as ringtones. So if you have a few dollars to spare in your quest for looking like a movie star, Motorola has got just the thing you need. Luckily, the RAZR V3 BLK has the brains to back up the beauty.\r\n\r\n--Reviewed by Michael Oryl, editor in chief of www.MobileBurn.com\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nThin\r\n\r\n7 hours of talk time\r\n\r\nQuad-band GSM\r\n\r\nGood antenna reception\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nExpensive\r\n\r\nUnusual Keypad\r\n\r\nYour friends will try to steal it\r\n\r\nSo if you have a few dollars to spare in your quest for looking like a movie star, Motorola has got just the thing you need.

            "description": "With the Forerunner 405, Garmin has finally put thepower of GPS location-based date into a sleek sport watch that can be worn all day. Runners no longer have to choose between function and fashion. Garmin's ANT + Sport wireless platform that wirelessly sends your data to your computer and a touch bezel that lets you change screens with a simple tap (no more fumbling for buttons) run make this not just a leap forward in GPS-enabled fitness devices, but in training devices period. Forerunner 405 comes in two color options \u2014 black or green.\r\n\r\nThe Power Of Location-Based Data\r\n\r\nAnyone who has used Garmin's Forerunner 205 or 305 already understands the power that attaching location data to traditional measurements like distance, speed, time, calories burned, and heart rate can provide. Knowing exactly where you worked hardest, ran fastest (or most slowly), and lets you tailor your workouts to improve for specific distances, conditions, and types of terrain. It gives a complete picture of how you interact with every portion of your run.\r\n\r\nWatch Results\r\n\r\nLoaded with serious training features, Forerunner 405 continuously monitors your time, distance, pace, calories and heart rate (when paired with heart rate monitor). Each run is stored in memory so you can review and analyze the data to see how you've improved.\r\n\r\nThe high-sensitivity GPS receiver sustains satellite reception, whether you\u2019re tackling a trail or jogging through the urban canyons of skyscrapers. The Forerunner 405 is water-resistant (IPX7) and can be used outdoors or indoors (with an optional foot pod), making it the ultimate year-round, all-weather training tool.\r\n\r\nForerunner 405 is available with or without a heart rate monitor (see the versions tab) to help you make the most out of your training. Versions with a digital heart rate monitor continuously track heart beats per minute. Train in a certain heart rate zone to improve your fitness level or compare your pace and heart rate to past performance on the same run.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary patent-pending touch bezel on the face of the watch makes navigating the options easier than ever. Simply by tapping, holding or running a finger along the bezel, runners can begin a new workout, access their training history or challenge a Virtual Partner. The Forerunner 405 makes training with a Virtual Partner easy and efficient. Runners can adjust the Virtual Partner\u2019s pace without stopping in the middle of a workout, and the Virtual Partner is always on and ready for a challenge.\r\n\r\nRun, Sync, Store and Share\r\n\r\nOne of Garmin's most ambitious decisions has been to approach fitness devices as a total platform with their \"ANT + Sport\" connectivity system. All of Garmin's new fitness devices, including the Forerunner 405, Edge 605 and 705 bike computers, and Forerunner 50 heart rate monitor watches, will interface wirelessly with any devices that are compatible wiht the \"ANT + Sport\" protocol, including devices from other manufacturers.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve logged the miles, the ANT+Sport wireless technology automatically transfers data to your computer when the Forerunner is in range. No cables, no hookups. The data\u2019s just there, ready for you to analyze, categorize and share through Garmin's online community, Garmin Connect or optional Garmin Training Center software. You can wirelessly send workouts from your computer to Forerunner, too.\r\n\r\nShare Wirelessly\r\n\r\nWith Forerunner 405 you can share your locations, advanced workouts and courses wirelessly with other Forerunner 405 users. Now you can send your favorite workout to your buddy to try, or compete against a friend's recorded course. Sharing data is easy. Just select \"transfer\" to send your information to nearby units.\r\n\r\nCross-Train\r\n\r\nTake your training inside with the versatile Forerunner 405. Pair it with an optional foot pod to track your speed, distance and running cadence indoors when a GPS signal is unavailable. This new design clips onto your laces for easy removal and automatically turns on when you start moving. You can also add a speed/cadence bike sensor to track the speed and distance of your cycling workouts.\r\n\r\nBe Part of A Community\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Garmin acquired Motion-based, the largest shared repository of customer-generated gps-based routes, courses and maps. This was a significant move for Garmin to support the gps user community and bring a wealth of route options to gps users. With a simple connection to your computer, you can join a worldwide network of cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts through Garmin Connect our new, one-stop site for data analysis an sharing.\r\n\r\nYou can also upload to optional Garmin Training Center software for further analysis. Garmin Training Center stores large quanities of workout and ride data. Some of the things you can do are\r\n\r\nReview your workout data, including pace/speed, distance, time, calories burned; and if available, heart rate, cadence and detailed elevation.\r\n\r\nView a detailed graph of your workout data, plotted over time or distance.\r\n\r\nView a map of your workout that shows the exact path you traveled.\r\n\r\nCategorize your workout history according to type of activity.\r\n\r\nReview previous workouts, which are saved by day and week.\r\n\r\nCreate customized workouts with specific goals and rest intervals. Then send them to your fitness device.*\r\n\r\nSchedule workouts for a specific day with calendar.\r\n\r\nGet custom workout templates designed by the experts at TrainingPeaks.com\r\n\r\nWhat's In The Box\r\n\r\nForerunner 405, USB ANT stick, Heart Rate Monitor, AC adapter, Charging clip, Owner's manual, Quick reference guide"

            "description": "Aspiring meteorologists and will be thrilled with this La Crosse Technology wireless weather station. Ideal for darkrooms, greenhouses, or other environments that require a consistent temperature reading, the WS-7014CH records indoor temperature, humidity, and remote temperature as measured by the included TX29U-IT remote sensor. For those who need multiple temperature readings, the unit is compatible with up to three remote sensors, and displays the information in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. If gauging current temperature isn't enough to satisfy, the station also forecasts upcoming weather conditions based on changing air pressure, employing several user-friendly icons, such as clouds, raindrops, or the sun, in the display. The forecast is approximately 75 percent accurate for 12 to 20 hours.\r\n\r\nLike all La Crosse Technology products, the included clock and date indicator receive their readings from the U.S. atomic clock in Fort Collins, Colorado, ensuring that the time is always 100 percent accurate. In addition, the weather station stores both daily maximum and minimum temperatures in its memory. The remote sensor is accurate up to 330 feet away with no obstructions, and approximately 50 to 65 feet away if exterior or interior walls block the weather station. Other features include a 12- or 24-hour time mode and an air-pressure tendency arrow. The unit is comfortable either hanging on a wall or free standing and measures 3-1/2 by 5-1/2 by 1-1/4 inches (W x H x D).

            "description": "This Projection Alarm Clock sets to the U.S. atomic clock to maintain absolute time accuracy. It also monitors indoor temperature and humidity, and outdoor temperature with a wireless sensor. The projection arm projects time and/or outdoor temperature onto the wall or ceiling (projection can be rotated). The time alarm with snooze keeps you always on time. Tip if you have trouble getting the sensor to work: 1.Bring both units inside and have the units 3-5 feet apart with nothing in-between them. 2.Remove the batteries from both units. 3.Press one of the buttons on the display at least 20 times to clear all memory. Verify that the display is blank before proceeding. 4.Using a good quality alkaline battery place them back into the remote sensor; making sure they are installed according to the diagrams in the battery compartment. Next, taking care not to press any buttons, reinstall the batteries in the display according to the diagram in the battery compartment. 5.Do not press any buttons for at least 15 minutes after installing the batteries. (Let them establish a good connection.) 6.An outdoor temperature should be showing on your display. You can now put your outdoor sensor back outside.\r\n\r\nAlong with its time alarm and snooze function, this advanced alarm clock offers a wide range of useful information in an organized format on its large LCD display. The unit provides the indoor and outdoor temperature, indoor humidity level, and the time of day (hour, minute, and second). The radio-controlled time and date is set by the U.S. atomic clock, automatically updating for Daylight Saving Time (with an \"on/off\" option). For exceptional convenience, the unique gadget projects the time and outdoor temperature, alternating, in easy-to-read numbers onto walls or ceilings. Users can even rotate the projection arm by 90 degrees and adjust intensity for the best possible viewing. Other features include time-zone setting, manual time setting, and automatic projection focus. The wireless sensor runs on two AA batteries, and the clock can operate from the included AC adapter or two backup AA batteries. Compact enough for any bedroom or office, the freestanding clock measures 5-1/2 by 2 by 3-3/5 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty.\r\n\r\nProduct Features:\r\n\r\nProjection alarm clock displays time and temperature onto wall or ceiling\r\n\r\nTime of day updated via U.S. atomic clock for radio-controlled accuracy\r\n\r\nAutomatic projection focus; manual time-setting option; large LCD\r\n\r\nClock requires 2 AA batteries and included AC adapter to operate\r\n\r\nMeasures 5-1/2 by 2 by 3-3/5 inches; 1-year limited warranty\r\n\r\n"

Thanks to subwoofers built right into the desktop speakers, you'll enjoy powerful and deep bass from a compact package that doesn't take up your limited space. The FX3022 was optimized for computers, MP3 players, and other digital sources, bringing your music, movies, and games to life.\r\n\r\nElegant Design for the Modern Home\r\nThe Expressionist Bass FX3022 was designed with today's digital home in mind. With a glossy black high-tech look, the speakers are just as much at home on your computer desk as they are out in your living room with your furniture. And at just 5.25 x 10 x 5.25 inches (WxHxD) and without a subwoofer to lug, you can easily move the system around wherever you need them, be it the living room, computer room, den, or porch.\r\n\r\nHigh Performance and Great Versatility\r\nWhether you are watching a video clip on the web or using your notebook computer to DJ your latest party, the FX3022 provides a great multimedia platform for all your digital media needs. Featuring 25 watts RMS of total continuous power, the system can easily fill your room with satisfying sound. With an auxiliary input jack and controls built right into the speaker, you can easily connect and adjust a source other than your computer, such as a CD player, DVD player, or iPod.\r\n\r\nBass Built Into the Base\r\nInstead of the subwoofer that most other speaker systems rely on, the Expressionist Bass system builds a four-inch long-throw subwoofer right into the base of each speaker.\r\n\r\nThe system has a downward firing orientation, causing the bass to reflect off the desktop and create a radiating 360-degree sound field for convincing slam in the lower registers. And thanks to psycho-acoustic algorithms from the system's integrated Maxx Bass technology, you get close to an extra octave of lower bass. The end result is that you get twice the bass in half the space.\r\n\r\nTwo 40mm Drivers for Full-Range Sound\r\nSpecially engineered 40mm drivers provide the mids and highs with great clarity. The two drivers are compartmentalized in a sealed chamber, ensuring that the pressure of the subwoofer doesn't mix and muddle the sound.\r\n\r\nThe internal chamber features a rounded architecture that decreases harsh diffractions (sound waves that bounce around in otherwise square corners) and standing waves (which get stuck in otherwise square corners) that can \"color\" the audio that you hear. What this means to you is a cleaner, more natural sound.\r\n\r\nThe Expressionist Bass FX3022 is backed by a one-year warranty."

            "description": "Canon\u2019s new EOS 50D bridges the gap between the novice and the seasoned pro with a perfect combination of high-speed and quality. It features an APS-C sized 15.1-megapixel CMOS sensor for tremendous images, new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for fine detail and superior color reproduction, and improved ISO capabilities up to 12800 for uncompromised shooting even in the dimmest situations. It features a refined 3.0-inch Clear View LCD (920,000 dots) monitor, supercharged Live View Function with Face Detection Live mode, plus a number of new automatic Image Correction settings and HDMI output for viewing images on an HDTV. Pick up the EOS 50D and you\u2019ll experience true digital inspiration! \r\n\r\nCanon EOS 50D Digital SLR Highlights \r\n\r\nNew 15.1-megapixel CMOS sensor with improved noise reduction\r\nThe EOS 50D features a newly-designed 15.1-megapixel APS-C sized CMOS sensor which is capable of recording up to 4752 x 3168 pixels with full 14-bit A/D conversion for extremely fine tonal gradation. Ready to capture images in an instant, the sensor is designed to work with Canon\u2019s EF and EF-S lenses with a conversion factor of 1.6x. It\u2019s capable of recording at sensitivities previously too noisy for shooting in low light or subjects in motion. With a maximum ISO rating of 12800 combined with a 4-level High ISO speed noise reduction function, images that would have been impossible without the use of a strobe or flash become simple to record. \r\n\r\n\r\nCapture up to 6.3 fps, in bursts of up to 90 JPEGs\r\nNext generation DIGIC 4 Image Processor for faster processing\r\nThe EOS 50D operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS 50D is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 6.3 fps, in bursts of up to 90 JPEGs (using an UDMA CF card), 60 JPEGs (using a CF card) consecutively or 16 RAW files, so you\u2019ll never, ever miss a shot. \r\n\r\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\r\nThis next generation DIGIC 4 Image Processor offers finer details and even more natural color reproduction, compared with the previous DIGIC III Image Processor. Since Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 chips use advanced signal processing technologies, they provide even faster operations, including write times to UDMA cards. It also enables Face Detection Live mode to detect and focus up to 35 face(s) to capture the best possible shot. Further, DIGIC 4 offers the improved Auto Lighting Optimizer that corrects brightness and contrast automatically, and Peripheral Illumination Correction for up to 40 EF lenses. DIGIC always maximizes performance between the capturing and recording stages of digital photography. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.0-inch Clear View LCD The EOS 50D features a bright, high resolution, 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor with 920,000 (dots/VGA) pixels and a broad viewing angle of 160 degrees horizontally and vertically. It offers a brighter and more detailed display than the EOS 40D, includes a new smudge-resistant coating, and is perfect for accessing camera settings like ISO, Metering modes AF Point selection and flash options. Plus, it\u2019s superb for reviewing, editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View Function. \r\n\r\n\r\nLive Face Detection Mode AF\r\nEnhanced Live View shooting includes Face Detection Live mode\r\nThe EOS 50D features Canon\u2019s most advanced Live View shooting thanks to the number of focusing modes available including Quick mode, Live mode and Face Detection Live mode. You can zoom in and navigate the composition 5x or 10x normal size, enabling critical focus. There\u2019s even 2 overlay grid options, perfect for lining up vertical and horizontal lines. In the studio, the camera can be controlled remotely with Live View Function when the camera is connected to a computer through a USB cable, or wirelessly if the optional Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E3A is used. \r\n\r\n9 cross-type high-precision sensors for accurate target subject acquisition\r\nThe EOS 50D has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF that uses cross-type points at f-stops of f/5.6 or faster, enabling the camera to focus faster, more accurately, and in difficult lighting situations. AF sensitivity is a stunning EV-0.5 to EV18. Adding to this AF performance, the EOS 50D incorporates a diagonally mounted cross-type sensor that is sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines at f/2.8, perfect for enhanced operation in dim light. The EOS 50D has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF and AI Servo AF. \r\n\r\nNew Lens Peripheral Illumination Correction setting\r\nCanon\u2019s exclusive Lens Peripheral Illumination setting takes into account any light falloff in the corners of the frame and corrects it, making for a perfectly exposed image. Correction data are detected automatically on a number of Canon EF lenses and can be entered manually through included the Canon EOS Utility software. \r\n\r\nUpdated EOS Integrated Cleaning System\r\nThe EOS 50D\u2019s Self Cleaning Sensor Unit eliminates stray dust that enters the camera when changing a lens or when out in the field. The sensor\u2019s IR-cut/Low-pass filter cleans itself automatically with ultrasonic vibrations every time the camera is turned on or off and features a new flourine coating to minimize dust adhesion. Dust missed by the cleaning unit is captured by Canon\u2019s Dust Delete Data Detection software and can be erased from the image file. \r\n\r\n\r\nSelf Cleaning Sensor Unit\r\nSelf Cleaning Sensor Unit\r\nA key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat this, the EOS 50D features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS 50D also has a coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor. \r\n\r\n\r\nDust Delete Data Detection\r\nDust Delete Data Detection\r\nDust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 3.3 or later software. A simple test shot of a plain, white object can be taken, using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in-camera, and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon\u2019s DPP software. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving. \r\n\r\nCreative Auto goes a step beyond full auto with on screen setting display The EOS 50D has a new Creative Auto mode and a quick control screen that helps novice users narrow the gap between fully automatic and manual control. While the camera will remain by default in fully automatic mode, frequently changed settings like flash, exposure compensation, image quality and more are all accessible through one easy screen interface designed for intuitive, quick action. A provided shooting guide serves as a quick-reference for on-the-fly operation. \r\n\r\nHDMI output for displaying full high-resolution images on a HDTV The EOS 50D includes a new HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) output device that enables High Definition display of your photographs on any HDTV with HDMI ports. It\u2019s remarkable to behold the details of your photographs in Full HD, and it\u2019s easy with the EOS 50D. Resolution is set automatically to match the TV to which you\u2019ve connected, and images are displayed in a full-frame 3:2 ratio with blacked out bars to the left and right of the image. \r\n\r\nCompatible with over 60 Canon EF/EF-S lenses and most EOS System accessories \r\n\r\nEF & EF-S Lenses\r\nThe EOS 50D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series lenses. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology is featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS 50D."

            "description": "<b>ProductDescription</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe goal of Callaway's X-Series irons has always been lofty: to set the performance standard for the industry. Now Callaway does it again with the X-22 irons, the best X-Series irons the company has ever made. Callaway's X-22 irons are dialed in for maximum performance, with such features as Precision Notch Weighting, VFT Technology, a Modified Tru-Bore design, and a tour-inspired head shape. It's no wonder that the X-22 irons won a gold medal in the \"game improvement irons\" category from Golf Digest's 2009 Hot List. As one tester said of the X-22s: \"I could hit these blindfolded. Sign me up right now.\" Currently sitting in tour player Rocco Mediate's bag, the X-22s received five stars in three of the four Hot List categories. The X-22s are the heirs of the unbelievably successful X-20 irons, which were used by Mediate as well as Senior U.S. Open Champion Eduardo Romero and LPGA winner Leta Lindley.\r\n\r\nThe X-22 irons are outfitted with several core technologies, including both relatively new innovations and technologies that have stood the test of time. Callaway maximized the perimeter weighting of the X-22s to create a moment of inertia (MOI) that's 10 percent higher than earlier versions, giving you more leeway on off-center strikes. This boosts the club's overall forgiveness and stability, while still maintaining the center-of-gravity position that produces an ideal trajectory and feel. The X-22s Variable Face Thickness (VFT) technology, meanwhile, maximizes ball speed and perimeter weighting to create even more distance and forgiveness. And a crucial improvement comes in the form of the S2H2 design, a patented technology that shortens the length of the hosel, allowing the weight to be moved lower and to the more useful perimeter area of the clubhead. Add in a 360-Degree Undercut Channel--which maximizes perimeter weighting by moving the center of gravity even lower and farther back--and you have a club that hits the ball far and straight even on rough swings.\r\n\r\nThe X-22 irons are also aesthetically pleasing, with a PGA Tour-inspired head shape that incorporates a thin top line and a narrow sole. As a result, the clubs look and feel great in your hand while still offering a large sweet spot--a must for casual players. Finally, the X-22s boast an advanced version of Callaway's original Tru-Bore design, which features a polycarbonate tip plug at the end of the shaft to dampen vibration and enhance feel and performance."

Enter the Everlast Pro Style training gloves, which help you train properly every time you step up to the bag. Made of synthetic leather, the Pro Style gloves are built to promote proper punching technique, with full padding on the front and back of the wrist that conforms to the natural shape of your fist. As a result, the gloves not only teach your hands how to punch correctly, but they also prevent injury. This dense two-layer foam sandwich also protects your wrists, as does the exclusive ThumbLok feature, which keeps your thumb and fist positioned correctly. Perhaps best of all, the gloves are designed using EverFresh materials, which guard against ever-present odors and microbes. Available in 12-, 14, and 16-ounce sizes, the gloves offer the choice of a traditional lace-up design or a hook-and-loop Velcro strap for quick on and off.\r\nAbout Everlast\r\nAlthough the name Everlast is synonymous with boxing, the company actually started out as a swimwear manufacturer in the Bronx in 1910. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, 17-year-old Jacob Golomb grew dissatisfied with the flimsy swimsuits of the time, which barely lasted a season. In response, he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name \"Everlast,\" and although the swimsuits did not last throughout history, the name did. In subsequent years, Golomb transformed his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more that 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. In 1919, Dempsey won the world heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb, and shortly afterward, Everlast became the boxing equipment headquarters throughout the world. Dedicated to leveraging the unique qualities represented by the Everlast brand--strength, dedication, individuality, and authenticity--the Everlast brand is now present in more than 101 countries and has 88 licenses worldwide.\r\n\r\n"

            "description": "Safari\r\n\r\nThe large Multi-Touch screen on iPad lets you see web pages as they were meant to be seen \u2014 one page at a time. With vibrant color and sharp text. So whether you\u2019re looking at a page in portrait or landscape, you can see everything at a size that\u2019s actually readable. And with iPad, navigating the web has never been easier or more intuitive. Because you use the most natural pointing device there is: your finger. Scroll through a page just by flicking your finger up or down on the screen. Or pinch to zoom in or out on a photo. There\u2019s also a thumbnail view that shows all your open pages in a grid, to let you quickly move from one page to the next.\r\n\r\n\r\nMail\r\nSee and touch your email in ways you never could before. In landscape, you get a split-screen view showing both an opened email and the messages in your inbox. To see the opened email by itself, turn iPad to portrait, and the email automatically rotates and fills the screen. No matter which orientation you use, you can scroll through your mail, compose a new email using the large, onscreen keyboard, or delete messages with nothing more than a tap and a flick. If someone emails you a photo, you can see it right in the message. You can also save the photos in an email directly to the built-in Photos app. And iPad works with all the most popular email providers, including MobileMe, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, and AOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos\r\nWith its crisp, vibrant display and unique software features, iPad is an extraordinary way to enjoy and share your photos. For example, the Photos app displays the photos in an album as though they were in a stack. Just tap the stack, and the whole album opens up. From there, you can flip through your pictures, zoom in or out, or watch a slideshow. You can even use your iPad as a beautiful digital photo frame while it\u2019s docked or charging. And there are lots of ways to import photos: You can sync them from your computer, download them from an email, or import them directly from your camera using the optional Camera Connection Kit.\r\n\r\nStar Trek is available on iTunes.\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nThe large, high-resolution screen makes iPad perfect for watching any kind of video: from HD movies and TV shows to podcasts and music videos. Switch between widescreen and full screen with a double-tap. Because iPad is essentially one big screen, with no distracting keypad or buttons, you feel completely immersed in whatever you\u2019re watching.\r\n\r\n\r\nYouTube\r\nThe YouTube app organizes videos so they\u2019re easy to see and navigate. To watch one, just tap it. When you\u2019re watching in landscape, the video automatically plays in full screen. And with its high-resolution display, iPad makes the latest HD YouTube videos look positively amazing.\r\n\r\n\r\niPod\r\nWith the iPod app, all your music is literally at your fingertips. Browse by album, song, artist, or genre with a simple flick. To play a song, just tap it. iPad even displays album art at full size. Listen to your music with the powerful built-in speaker or with wired or Bluetooth wireless headphones.\r\n\r\n\r\niTunes\r\nA tap of the iTunes icon lets you browse and buy music, TV shows, and podcasts \u2014 or buy and rent movies \u2014 wirelessly, right from your iPad. Choose from thousands of movies and TV shows (in both standard and high definition), along with thousands of podcasts and millions of songs. Preview songs before you buy them. Or just sync iPad with the content you already have in your iTunes library on your Mac or PC.\r\n\r\n\r\nApp Store\r\niPad runs almost 140,000 apps from the App Store. Everything from games to business apps and more. And new apps designed specifically for iPad are highlighted, so you can easily find the ones that take full advantage of its features. Just tap the App Store icon on the screen to browse, buy, and download apps wirelessly, right to the iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\niBooks\r\nThe iBooks app is a great new way to read and buy books.1 Download the free app from the App Store and buy everything from classics to best sellers from the built-in iBookstore. Once you\u2019ve bought a book, it\u2019s displayed on your Bookshelf. Just tap it to start reading. The high-resolution, LED-backlit screen displays everything in sharp, rich color, so it\u2019s easy to read, even in low light.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nFinding your way is a completely new experience on iPad. Tap to view maps from above with high-resolution satellite imagery, up close with street view, or with topography in a new terrain view \u2014 all using Google Services. Search for a nearby restaurant or landmark, then get directions from your current location.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nWith its expansive display and large, onscreen keyboard, iPad makes jotting down notes easy. In landscape view, you see not only a note-taking page but a list of all your notes. iPad even circles the current note in red, so you can see where you are at a glance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalendar\r\niPad makes it easy to stay on schedule by displaying day, week, month, or list views of your calendar. You can see an overview of a whole month or the details of a single day. iPad even shows multiple calendars at once, so you can manage work and family schedules at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts\r\nThe Contacts app on iPad makes finding names, numbers, and other important information quicker and easier than ever before. A new view lets you see both your complete contacts list and a single contact simultaneously. Need directions? Tap an address inside a contact and iPad automatically opens Maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Screen\r\nThe Home screen gives you one-tap access to everything on iPad. You can customize your Home screen by adding your favorite apps and websites or using your own photos as the background. And you can move apps around to arrange them in any order you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpotlight Search\r\nSpotlight Search allows you to search across iPad and all of its built-in apps, including Mail, Contacts, Calendar, iPod, and Notes. It even searches apps you\u2019ve downloaded from the App Store. So no matter what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s never more than a few taps away.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessibility\r\niPad comes with a screen reader, support for playback of closed-captioned content, and other innovative universal access features \u2014 right out of the box. There\u2019s no additional software to buy or install. These features make iPad easier to use for people who have a vision impairment, are deaf or hard of hearing, or have a physical or learning disability."

The company name is an acronym for \"Hans Riegel, Bonn\" and stands as a reminder of Haribo's continuing loyalty to early traditions. After Hans Riegel died during World War II, his son, also named Hans Riegel, took over the factory and expanded its operations, taking over many local confectionery manufacturers in countries all over the world. Currently, Haribo operates five factories in Germany and 13 throughout the rest of Europe. The company also has sales offices in almost every country in Europe as well as in the Unites States. Haribo's German catch phrase is \"Haribo macht kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso,\" which translates as \"Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo.\"\r\nProduct Description\r\nHaribo Gummy Gold Bears Candy is soft, chewy and translucent. And they are bursting with beary yummy flavor. There is nothing quite as whimsically delicious as gummy bears, a candy popular the world over for its sprightly personality and fruity taste. Squeeze them, line them up and make them dance, or just plain eat them. Haribo Gold-Bears are a mixed delight of white/pineapple, green/strawberry, yellow/lemon, orange/orange, and red/raspberry gummy bears."

No buffeting. \r\n\r\nJames Dyson, who for the past 30 years has continuously revolutionized the vacuum cleaner industry, has turned his attention to addressing the everyday fan. \r\n\r\nUntil today, conventional electric fans have gone largely unchanged. The fundamental problem has remained the same for more than 125 years; the blades chop the air before it hits you, creating an uneven airflow and unpleasant buffeting. \r\n\r\nWhat is Buffeting? \r\nBuffeting is caused when conventional fan blades chop the air before it hits you. Dyson has solved this problem by developing a fan with no blades, which uses Air Multiplier\u2122 technology to amplify the surrounding air up to 15 times, giving you an uninterrupted stream of smooth air."

While Corelle doesn't recommend home tests, this casual 16-piece dinnerware set is still fairly indestructible and is a real asset for busy families. Livingware is easy to maintain as it's dishwasher-, microwave- and oven-safe and is never off-limits for small children to use and handle because of its light weight and durability."

            "description": "The best thing about these diamond earrings is that they can be worn every single day to show them off. Flirty and eye-catching, each princess-cut stone rests in a four-prong basket setting made of platinum. The diamonds have a total carat weight of 3/4 carats. The smooth finish of the metal and the light-reflecting cut of the gems make the pair immediately seen. Posts with screw backs keep the shiny baubles securely on the ears. This is an essential accessory that can be worn frequently and with almost anything--it is certain to be a favorite.\r\nThese are exceptional quality diamonds. With a minimum G-H color rating, they are in the upper-most range of near-colorless and appear dazzling white to the eye. They have a minimum clarity of VS2, meaning there are very small inclusions that are difficult to see under 10x magnification, and impossible to see with the unaided eye."

(2) Check skin tone: Apply the TRIA skin sensor (included) firmly against your skin in the area you plan to treat, then press the blue button until the light turns green.

The XT's 7-inch-wide all-terrain tires and wide profile make it equally suitable for riding on trails, streets, sidewalks, grass, dirt roads, and even hills. Outfitted with a robust new fender design, extended-range lithium-ion batteries, and specially tuned software, the Segway XT will go practically anywhere you want to go.\r\nThe XT was specifically developed for stability, comfort, and performance on rough and uneven terrain. Its low-pressure tires smooth the ride on bumpy surfaces and minimize trail impact, while the transporter's wider track will prove more stable on uneven ground than the original Segway HT. The XT's software has been modified to support the new tire size and to improve handling, with inertial sensors that continually monitor a rider's position relative to gravity. This allows the XT to adjust for changes in terrain while keeping you upright."

Now you can get the look of a palm leaf ceiling fan just by covering your standard fan blades with these palm blades! The Palm-Leaf Ceiling Fan Blades are designed to look and act as real palm-frond fans, evenly distributing air from the ends of the blades, rather than directly down, so there's no annoying downdraft. The Palm-Leaf Ceiling Fan Blades can be used year 'round to distribute cooled or warmed air. Simply slide each \"leaf\" onto your existing fan blade, and tighten the thumbscrews. No tools needed! The Palm-Leaf Ceiling Fan Blades are made of ABS resin that wipes clean easily. You get five Palm-Leaf Ceiling Fan Blades, each 15\" wide, 23\" long, and weighing about 6 ounces, for fan blades up to 6\" wide. When ordering Palm-Leaf Ceiling Fan Blades, please specify color: ivory, natural, burl, oak or sand."

This document is then secured within the Steiner Sports main offices. Each hand-signed collectible is examined for quality and signature condition. If the collectible meets the Steiner Sports standard of excellence a tamper-proof Steiner Sports hologram is affixed to the product. Once the hand-signed collectible has passed the steps listed above, a Steiner Sports Certificate of Authenticity is created for the collectible.

Then it quickly heats up again (a green light shines when the perfect temperature is achieved) and makes four more, each 4 by 4-1/2 inches and blessed with the deep indentations that hold so much butter, syrup, and fruit. Because the grids are nonstick and the exterior is hard plastic, the waffle iron cleans easily. It also stands up for compact storage until the following weekend arrives and waffle appetites again reach their peak. The 1,200-watt waffle iron measures 11-1/2 inches wide, 5 inches high, and 12-3/4 inches deep. It carries a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack"

The Company has passed from father to son and remains a family owned business even today: Owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder.\r\n\r\nIt has come a long way over the past almost 80 years \u2013 from a small carpenter\u2019s workshop to a modern, global enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe LEGO Group is a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company is still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family who founded it in 1932.\r\n\r\nThe LEGO Group is engaged in the development of children\u2019s creativity through playing and learning and it is this core philosophy that is built into every LEGO brand watch and clock."

            "description": "So there's this pop singer... you may have heard of her? Madonna, she's called, and the word is that she's basically all image; she went through a put-your-hands-all-over-my-body phase, then she got spiritual, and then she started wearing cowboy hats. Between all the gossip columns and photo shoots, though, she's left an unmatched trail of devastatingly wonderful singles--roaring dance records, tender ballads, and a curious combination of the two that is her personal specialty (\"Secret\" and \"Ray of Light\"). How many artists' best-of-the-second-decade collections crowd out legitimate hits? (\"American Pie,\" anyone? \"This Used to Be My Playground\"?) Unlike 1990's Immaculate Collection, GHV2 doesn't have any new material; \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,\" from Evita, and the glorious '60s pastiche \"Beautiful Stranger\" are the only songs that haven't appeared on a Madonna album before. But it compresses her past 10 years worth of records into an hour of one peak after another. --Douglas Wolk"

Not only is the Boogie Board Tablet new, it's revolutionary! The Boogie Board tablet is the tree-friendly electronic alternative to paper, pencils, and pens. With it, users of all ages will truly say goodbye to paper forever - and it's just as easy to use! Simply press on the surface with the included stylus or other suitable writing instrument (even your finger) to create an image and then erase with the push of a button. With the Boogie Board tablet, you'll never be without a memo pad again. No pen or pencil, no problem! Keep one by the home phone and by your computer at work to jot down memos, make to do lists, leave messages for others, capture your next big idea, and more. Keep one in your car, and you'll never be caught again looking for a piece of paper and pen to write important to-do's to get from the grocery store on the way home. But the Boogie Board tablet is more than just a memo pad. Students will find it's the perfect tool for practicing handwriting/arithmetic, drawing pictures and playing games (especially young and developmentally challenged students). If you're a coach, you can even use the Boogie Board tablet to diagram the winning play. Say goodbye to dry erase boards with smelly, dried up markers."

How about those days you work late at the office, knowing you\u2019ll have a mess to clean up when you get home. Try the non-toxic PetZoom Pet Park. It prevents messy indoor accidents by giving your pet a place to go potty instead of on your floor or furniture. Its 3-stage protection keeps your home clean and odor-free. Your pet uses the synthetic grass mat to urinate. The elevated grid tray keeps the mat high above the liquid, which falls down into the collection tray in the base. Just empty the tray at the end of the day and wash in warm soapy water. It holds 1 gallon of liquid. The reusable surface mat rinses clean and stores easily to stay fresh and sanitary. Great for porches, patios, and balconies too. You can use it for potty-training your young pet, or to help your mature or special-needs dog. 30-day money-back guarantee."

            "description": "Man by Calvin Klein was launched in October of 2007 and proposed as a new classic for the modern Calvin Klein man, aged from 25 to 40. The name itself is programmatic and unambiguous, like an English translation of L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent. Simple, brief, to the point. You are going to smell the essence of masculinity if you are to take your cue from the name of the fragrance. The packaging is sleek, modernist, with an architectural sense of proportions and looks good. The fragrance was created by perfumers Jacques Cavallier and Harry Fremont from Firmenich in collaboration with consultant Ann Gottlieb. All these people are old hands at marketing successful mainstream fragrances. Man offers therefore a mainstream palatability but without coming across as depersonalized. It plays the distinctiveness card, but in a well reined in manner. The fragrance bears a typical masculine fresh aromatic, woody and spicy signature around the linear heart of the scent which itself is dark, fruity, and sweet enough to feel feminine. This rich amber-fruity accord is made even more seductive thanks to just the right amount of citrus-y counterpoint, which never clarifies the scent but on the contrary helps to deepen the dark fruity sensation."

            "description": "The Ghost Meter has been calibrated to ignore the extremely subtle EMF emissions surrounding the human body, yet is still sensitive enough to detect the small, distinct, erratic EMF energy fluctuations frequently found at reputed haunted locations. The Ghost Meter provides three corroborating indicators of EMF emission strength. A needle based display, LED lights, and an adjustable audio signal. The response time of this meter is excellent, easily outperforming more expensive EMF meters. It can also be operated in silent mode so it doesn't interfere with EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) recordings or distract other investigators during an investigation. Compare the value this meter offers compared to other brands. There is no other offer that comes close to providing these levels of features and performance for the price. You've seen television ghost hunters use similar detectors. Now you can get your own and start investigating the unknown."

In contrast to a Heads Up Display projected on the lens the Transcend is much less obtrusive and consumes far less power. It is the ideal display for this application's size and power consumption requirements.\r\nWhat is Recon HQ? Do I need to sign up for this?\r\nRecon HQ is the best place to keep track of all the information your Transcend is collecting along with staying current with updates to the goggle's software. Although we encourage you to sign up for the online community that goes along with it, it is not required. Download the software here.\r\nWhat will this goggle tell me? What are the different screens for?\r\nThe Transcend displays stats about your ski run in real time while Recon HQ makes it easy to review the day when you can plug in to your computer. The Dashboard or default screen in the Transcend displays current speed, the ability to start and stop your chrono, a clock so you never need to take your gloves off and a customizable space for your altimeter, thermostat, odometer, or vertical odometer. Other screens will allow you to review information about the last run you took, cumulative data from your different odometers, and your chrono records. Finally there is a preferences pane that allows you to customize the dashboard, change units and language, and set the date and time while wearing the goggle.\r\nIs it waterproof?\r\nThe Transcend is designed for active snow use and the entire electronics module is sealed, it should not fail because of water penetration but it's worth noting that the Transcend is not fully waterproof and cannot be submerged in liquid H2O. If you have any reason to believe that water may have gotten inside the electronics module turn the Transcend off until it can dry fully."

            "description": "Experience nature up close with the Live Butterfly Garden from Insect Lore. This enthralling educational kit gives kids the opportunity to observe butterflies through every stage of their lifecycle. Children ages four and up can observe five real caterpillars eat and grow to form their chrysalis and then emerge as Painted Lady butterflies. Children will love feeding the butterflies in their included observation habitat and then releasing them into the wild.\r\n\r\nLive Butterfly Garden\r\nAt a Glance:\r\n\r\nAge: 4 years and up\r\nRequirements: Larvae, which are available with the included mail-in coupon ($5 shipping and handling required; ships to all U.S. states except Hawaii).\r\n\r\nWarranty: Insect Lore guarantees that at least 3 of the 5 butterfly larvae sent through the mail will metamorphose into adult butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWatch larvae turn into butterflies! View larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n12-inch habitat, guide, dropper, and coupon. View larger.\r\nLive Caterpillars Mailed Directly to You\r\nThe Butterfly Garden comes with a coupon to send away for five caterpillars. The caterpillars are hatched from eggs in a butterfly nursery and mailed to your home in a special clear container, complete with caterpillar food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLive caterpillars and food\r\n\r\nKeeping the caterpillars out of direct sunlight, children can watch them eat, grow, and after seven to ten days, form their chrysalides and begin their transformation into butterflies. The transformation from caterpillar to butterfly normally takes two to three weeks: seven to ten days in caterpillar stage, and seven to ten days in chrysalis stage. Insect Lore guarantees that at least three of the five caterpillars you receive will grow into adult butterflies.\r\n\r\nObserve the Metamorphosis Up Close\r\nThe Butterfly Garden comes with a pop-up butterfly observation habitat, which is a cylindrical mesh container measuring 12 inches tall. Once the caterpillars become chrysalides, they can be transferred to the habitat, where they will complete their transformation into adult Painted Lady butterflies. Children will be excited to keep a close eye on the changing chrysalides and watch this seemingly magical metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nYour Very Own Butterflies\r\nOnce the butterflies emerge, children can have lots of fun feeding them and watching them eat. The kit comes with a dropper for squeezing sugar water into the habitat for the butterflies to drink. It is recommended that flowers be placed in the habitat for the butterflies to rest on while they enjoy their meals. Kids will delight in observing the butterflies unfurl their proboscises to suck up the sugar water.\r\n\r\nIf you receive your butterflies during warmer weather, when temperatures are above 55 degrees, you can experience the excitement of releasing the butterflies into the wild. Caterpillars are available for delivery year-round, so if yours arrive in a colder month, you can keep your fully-grown butterflies in the mesh habitat for their lifespan, which is about two to four weeks.\r\n\r\nAdditional mail-in certificates are available for order, so once you've released your butterflies, you can reuse the Butterfly Garden and experience the magic of metamorphosis again and again.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\nMesh butterfly habitat, feeding dropper, activity guide, complete instructions, and mail-in coupon for five caterpillars, and food.\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nWitness one of nature's most spectacular transformations up close with this reusable, collapsible habitat. Fine, transparent mesh lets you see butterfly metamorphosis up close. Product includes easy-to-use feeder and complete instructions for habitat. Butterfly larvae with food shipped directly to your home. The habitat collapses for storage when not in use. You can adopt and raise a handful of caterpillars, watch them transform into painted lady butterflies, then lift the garden cover to release your beautiful specimens into the wild. This exciting habitat makes a fabulous introduction to the miracles of nature. The larvae and food available round the year."

Starting from the Top Ramp, the Wheelie cars zip down bright red ramps that curve through tunnels and down toward the finish line.\r\n\r\nBecause the Rampway has two spiral ramps and two cars, your child can share and race with friends. But the fun doesn't stop at zooming down the tracks. Kids can gas up their cars, take them up and down the moveable elevators, or drive them along the paths located at the bases near the finish lines. Other features include a moveable car lift and elevator and images of Little People at work and play in Wheelieville.\r\n\r\nSometimes the cars will flip or fly off the ramps when they're let go up top at the starting lines, but this adds to the fun and challenge your child will experience as he strategizes ways to beat his opponent. The guzzling gas, honking, and cheering sound effects add another layer of racing fun to this toy.\r\n\r\nThe Rampway includes moveable parts, such as stop signs, a gas pump, and a hinged sign that spins when cars zoom through. Young kids, especially toddlers, will be attracted to the generous size of this toy.\r\n\r\nEddie and the Mystery Driver DVD\r\nThe Fisher-Price Little People Wheelies Stand 'n Play Rampway comes with a Little People Wheelies DVD featuring \"Eddie and the Mystery Driver,\" a short animation based on Fisher-Price Little People characters. Children will love experiencing the world of Wheelieville, where all its citizens love to drive. The film stars Eddie, a fast and popular racer, as he practices for a town-wide race. With his best friend Freddie navigating, Eddie meets the rubber-burning Mystery Driver.\r\n\r\nSpeedy Assembly\r\nAll you'll need to put the Stand 'n Play Rampway together are three AA batteries for powering the sound effects and a Phillips-head screwdriver to tighten the accompanying screws. Upper and lower wall pieces snap snuggly together and are set into the two base pieces.\r\n\r\nThe 11 ramp sections are numbered for easy assemblage. Additional pieces to assemble include the top ramp, two balconies, a car lift, and elevator.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\nTwo Wheelie cars, 19 pieces for assembly, seven screws, Wheelies DVD, and instructions. \r\nEND\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nLooking for a \u201cwheelie\u201d fun way to play with Little People Wheelies? On the Stand \u2019n Play Rampway, they zip and zoom up and down and all around. It\u2019s over two feet tall, so the \u201cwheelies\u201d really zoom down each of the two spiral ramps.

            "description": "A smart, space-saving choice for busy households, this innovative appliance features a 1.7-cubic-foot stainless-steel drum and functions as both a washing machine and a dryer. The compact, front-load unit can be built right into a kitchen cabinet, and it will work off a regular power socket as it only requires 115 voltage~60Hz. Even more, the appliance does not require external venting for the dryer--moisture during the dry cycle condenses into water and runs into a drain, rather than being released as damp, hot air through a vent.\r\n\r\nThe washer/dryer's user-friendly electronic control panel with LED display makes it exceptionally easy to operate. Standard wash cycles include delicate, heavy duty, and normal, with options for prewash and extra-rinse. For added convenience, the appliance comes with handy dispensers that release detergent, fabric softener, and bleach automatically into the load at the right time. It also offers six fabric-care wash cycles, auto-select wash/rinse temperature, a spin cycle on/off option, three water levels, and 60 water temperatures. Standard dry cycles include heavy duty, normal, and timed. Other highlights include a self-locking door, two dryer-temperature settings, a self-cleaning lint filter, 24-hour delay start, ultra-quiet operation, and adjustable leveling legs to balance the machine if it sits on uneven ground. The ETL-approved washer/dryer combo measures 21-9/16 by 23-7/8 by 33-3/4 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty.\r\nProduct Description\r\nCompact laundry solution for small spaces with no venting capabilities, making it the perfect companion for small homes, apartments, cabins, RVs, and boats. Haier's washer and dryer combo model makes it possible for you to do it all in one step! Put in a dirty load, and with the touch of a button, it'll come out fresh, dry, and smelling sweet. It's a great time-saver for busy families that need to do laundry frequently. Key features include: auto select wash and rinse temperatures; water-saving rinse option; self-locking door; adjustable leveling legs; and a 1 year warranty. The Haier Ventless Washer/Dryer Combo HWD1000 is an elegant all-in-one solution for the vexing problems of limited space and lack of venting "

Dim the lights to watch a movie and the sensor dims the backlight, which also helps reduce unnecessary power consumption.\r\n\r\nAmbient Sensor: Get a natural looking picture whether you are watching movies late at night or playing video games during the day with an Ambient Sensor that automatically adjusts the picture color based on a room's lighting.\r\n\r\nBRAVIA Engine 2: Enjoy sharp, vibrant, life-like images while optimizing color and contrast and significantly reducing noise with the BRAVIA Engine 2 fully digital processor.\r\n\r\n6 HD Inputs: Get versatile HD connection options with 6 HD inputs, including 4 HDMI inputs to connect a Blu-ray Disc player, PlayStation3 gaming console or any other HDMI-capable equipment. Two HD component inputs provide added HD-capable connectivity, while a PC input (HD-15 pin) lets you use your HDTV as a computer monitor.\r\n\r\n24p True Cinema: Movies consist of 24 images per second, and cannot be faithfully reproduced on conventional televisions, resulting in unnatural, jerky movements. But 24p True Cinema displays the 24 progressive images as they should be, in the same sequence as the original film source. Now, you can recreate the visual clarity of cinema-quality movies in the comfort of your own home.\r\n\r\nUSB Input: Share your photos on the big screen or listen to your favorite music. Simply connect your digital camera, USB-enabled MP3 player, or USB storage device directly to your HDTV's USB input.\r\n\r\nBRAVIA Sync Compatible: Conveniently operate and control other BRAVIA Sync compatible devices--including BRAVIA HDTVs, Blu-ray Disc Players, surround sound systems, Handycam camcorders and Cyber-shot digital still cameras, all with one remote control.\r\n\r\nVESA-compatible hole spacing uses an industry-standard mounting-hole pattern that can be used with VESA-compliant mounting brackets, taking the guesswork out of selecting the proper hardware for hanging your TV on the wall.\r\nBRAVIA EX500 Series HDTV\r\nKey Specifications\r\n\r\n    * Screen size: 40 inches\r\n    * CineMotion Reverse 3:2 Pulldown Technology: Yes\r\n    * 24p True Cinema Technology: Yes\r\n    * 3D Comb Filter: Yes\r\n    * Live Color Technology: Yes\r\n    * Auto Picture Setting w/ HDMI: Cinema, Photo, Graphics, Game\r\n    * Speakers: 2x 10W (20 watts of total power)\r\n    * 5.1 Channel Audio Out: Yes\r\n    * Dolby: Dolby Digital\r\n    * USB Applications: Photo Viewer (jpeg), Music Player (mp3), Video Player (mpeg1), Video Player (mpeg2 TS)\r\n    * Tuners: ATSC, NTSC, Clear QAM\r\n    * VESA wall mounting pattern: 300 x 300\r\n    * Warranty: 1 year labor and parts \r\n\r\nDimensions\r\n\r\n    * TV with stand: 39.1 x 25.1 x 10.25 inches (WxHxD); 36.2 pounds\r\n    * TV without stand: 39.1 x 23.6 x 4 inches (WxHxD); 31.3 pounds\r\n    * What size TV should you get? \r\n\r\nConnections\r\n\r\n    * HDMI: 4 (2 side, 2 rear; HDMI PC input capability)\r\n    * Component: 2 (rear)\r\n    * Composite A/V: 2 (1 side, 1 rear)\r\n    * RF: 1 (rear)\r\n    * USB 2.0: 1 (side)\r\n    * PC input (15-pin, D-Sub): 1 (rear)\r\n    * Analog audio inputs: 4 (1 side, 3 rear) \r\n\r\nWhat's in the Box\r\n\r\nBRAVIA EX500 Series HDTV, remote control (with batteries), AC power cord, table top stand, operating instructions"

            "description": "Get a nutritious start to your day with fresh tomato, carrot, apple, or orange juice--or invent your own healthy blend. This powerful (and some would say noisy) 600-watt juicer churns out a quart of juice in just one minute. An extra-wide feed tube saves chopping time since it accommodates whole tomatoes, carrots, and small apples, and the removable parts make this one of the fastest juicers to clean. To operate, simply turn the juicer on and insert washed whole or chopped fruits and vegetables through the feed tube--pulp and seeds will shoot out one side into the provided pulp container, and juice will pour out the spout. To catch the juice, you can use either a glass or a provided juice container with lid. The juice container features a handy divider to separate the juice from the froth when pouring. Weighing thirteen pounds, the juice extractor measures 15 by 6-1/2 by 16 inches and comes with a one-year warranty. A helpful instruction booklet that includes tips and recipes is included to get you started. --Ann Bieri\r\nFrom the Manufacturer\r\n\r\nChanging the World, One Apple at a Time\u2026\r\n\r\nUnrivalled power meets highest quality components and revolutionary design in this life changing appliance. Touted as North America\u2019s fastest juicer, after being timed making an 8-ounce glass of juice in an astonishing 5 seconds, the world\u2019s fastest juicer might be a more apt description. Designed by innovative, world-renowned engineer Keith Hensel in 1999, the Breville Juice Fountain was the world\u2019s first domestic juicer to accept whole fruit and vegetables with no chopping, peeling, slicing, or dicing.\r\n\r\nNamed for its ability to produce literally a fountain of continuous juice, where other juicers generate a mere trickle, the JE900 Juice Fountain has seriously changed the way the world looks at juice. Where traditional juice extractors require time consuming preparation, feeding, and cleaning, the Juice Fountain completes the whole home juicing experience in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee. The Juice Fountain\u2019s ability to juice whole fruit, to reduce juicing time by up to 90%, and to yield up to 30% more juice, stems from a combination of innovations. Even its unofficial tagline as \"a juice bar in your own home\" doesn\u2019t do justice to just how fast and convenient the machine is. Thousands of families from Australia to Japan and everywhere in between enjoy fresh, healthy juice every day thanks to the Breville JE900 Juice Fountain.\r\n\r\nAmazing Innovations\r\n\r\n\t600-Watt Centered Motor\r\nThe Juice Fountain\u2019s motor is positioned directly under the drive shaft so no power is lost in electrical transition or resistance. At 600 watts, the motor is one of the most powerful domestic juicers available, and its centered location directly over the drive shaft means a true 600 watts of power is delivered to the cutter and filter. The higher wattage not only delivers faster and more efficient juicing, it\u2019s also powerful enough to juice regularly without significant stress on the motor.\r\n\r\nPatented Center Knife Blade Cutter Assembly\r\n\r\nThe Juice Fountain is the world\u2019s only large feed tube juicer to feature a centered feed tube and knife blade cutter assembly. Other juicers receive fruit and vegetables toward the circumference of the cutter-blade putting uneven pressure on the cutter and filter. As a result, it is not possible to balance the cutting assembly to attain sufficient speed for optimum juicing. The patented Juice Fountain design accepts fruit directly on to the center of the cutting assembly where a small, dual-bladed Italian made knife shreds the pulp into tiny particles and pushes it against the filter.\r\n\r\nOver 14,000 RPMs!\r\n\r\nThe unique centered cutter assembly, together with the 600 watt motor, allows the Juice Fountain to deliver unparalleled speed to the filter. The Juice Fountain\u2019s Italian micro-mesh filter spins at an incredible 14,500 revolutions per minute. The greater the revolutions, the faster the fruit can be juiced, and the greater the pressure on the pulp against the filter. Breville\u2019s lightning speed filter \u2018G-forces\u2019 the maximum amount of juice from the pulp and makes an 8-ounce glass of juice in as little as 5 seconds (tested using apples). The 14,500 rpms of the Juice Fountain compares to about 5,000 rpms on most other juicers.\r\n\r\nItalian-Made Stainless Steel Micro Mesh Cutter and Filter\r\n\r\nItalian engineering is renowned for its uncompromising quality and eye for detail. The Juice Fountain\u2019s micromesh filter is no exception. Comparing this to other filters it is easy to see that the engineering differences are significant. The filter holes on the Breville filter are so tiny that the individual holes can\u2019t be detected with the naked eye yet the screen is see-through. The thousands and thousands of tiny, micro-mesh holes maximize the juicing surface area to squeeze every last drop of juice from the pulp. Because the holes are so small, they effectively block any seeds, pulp, or rind to deliver nothing but fresh, delicious juice.\r\n\r\n3-Inch Wide Feed Tube\r\n\r\nThe Juice Fountain features the largest circular feed tube of all juicers in America. The unique rounded shape allows for easy insertion of whole apples, pears, tomatoes, peeled oranges, even handfuls of carrots at a time. Where other juicers take several minutes of chopping, peeling, slicing, and dicing, the Breville is large enough and powerful enough to accept whole fruit. This revolutionary design reduces juicing time by up to 90%, making the Juice Fountain a practical way to get natural nutrients and vitamins for the whole family each and every day.\r\n\r\nExtra Large Pulp Container\r\n\r\nThe extra large pulp container is designed to fit a standard plastic grocery bag to capture all the pulp for no-fuss clean up. Because the pulp is exceptionally dry with the Breville Juicer, and the pulp container is so large, it is practical to juice continually for several minutes before the pulp container needs to be emptied. For those that don\u2019t want to waste the pulp, the Juice Fountain\u2019s free instruction manual has delicious recipes for muffins and cakes using the pulp.\r\n\r\nSmooth Rounded Dishwasher Safe Parts\r\n\r\nEasy cleaning was at the top of the priority list for the Breville design team when engineering the Juice Fountain. Having tested dozens of juicers and spoken to thousands of consumers, the overwhelming response was that juice extractors are just too difficult to clean. The Breville Juice Fountain is a delightful contrast. Not only is the pulp container designed to insert a grocery bag to capture the pulp, but there are only three other parts that require cleaning. All of them are top-shelf dishwasher safe and feature smooth, rounded surfaces that rinse easily under the tap. Even washing by hand takes only seconds as pulp residue slides right off the smooth surfaces. The Juice Fountain comes with a bonus cleaning brush designed to slide effortlessly around the micro-mesh cutter and filter making cleaning a breeze.\r\n\r\nBonus Juice Pitcher with Froth Separator\r\n\r\nThe Juice Fountain comes with a bonus 1-quart juice pitcher. Like the machine itself, the pitcher is cleverly designed with an adjustable froth separator. Some juice recipes produce a froth residue at the top of the juice and while some consumers enjoy the froth, others would rather drink their juice without it. The easy slide froth separator allows the user to have as little or as much froth as they desire. The bonus pitcher also comes with an air tight lid to store left over juice in the fridge.\r\n\r\nThe Breville Story\r\n\r\nBreville\u2019s first electrical appliance rolled off the factory line in 1932. Over 70 years, and 30 million satisfied customers later, they\u2019re still one of the world\u2019s most innovative name in kitchen electrics. From the world\u2019s first scissor action sandwich maker, to the world\u2019s first juicer to juice whole fruit, Breville continues to bring clever ideas to life. Their renowned design team ensures that every Breville product makes life simpler, works smarter, and looks better, than any other appliance on Earth. Despite Breville\u2019s global success, they only entered the U.S. market in January 2003 and are quickly becoming one of the fastest growing brands in the country. Breville have a proud history of innovation and an uncompromising vision to bring more great ideas to life.\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nPrepare delicious, vitamin-rich juices in seconds, thanks to the extra large feed chute and efficient stainless steel micro mesh filter. No need to pre-chop fruits and veggies such as apples, tomatoes, and carrots. Just place them in the chute and push with the pusher. While juicing in bulk, there's no need to disassemble the juice fountain to empty the pulp container, it just slides right out. A powerful motor pushes fruits and veggies through the mesh filter to separate seeds and fiber, maximizing juice output. You can have a glass of juice in 5 seconds, and be through clean up in not much more. The easy clean design has fewer parts and rounded smooth surfaces that can be easily rinsed after use."

            "description": "Suited for paddling on rivers, lakes and streams, the single-person Sevylor Rio inflatable canoe (model KCC305HF in green) features a design that's as close to a traditional North American Indian canoe as an inflatable boat will ever get. Its double hull construction makes it very rugged and rigid, and it offers the stability, maneuverability and sea worthiness normally found in a kayak. It can be paddled with either canoe or kayak paddles and is compatible with an optional motor mount (for attaching a Sevylor SBM 12V trolling motor). It comes with repair kit and nylon carry bag.\r\nSpecifications:\r\n\r\nColor: Green\r\nLength overall (LOA): 9 feet, 7 inches\r\nBeam: 3 feet, 2 inches\r\nWeight: 25 pounds\r\nMaximum engine power: Sevylor SBM 12V motor\r\nCapacity: 1 persons\r\nWeight capacity: 350 pounds\r\nAbout Sevylor\r\nIn 1948 in Vitry, a small suburb of Paris, France, Berco Grimbert created an electronics company called Societe Electronique de Vitry, or SEVY for short. Soon, a friend of Grimbert's from New York commissioned SEVY to produce high frequency welding machines capable of fusing a new material called PVC (poly vinyl chloride). SEVY's machines worked very well and the American friend developed a very successful business manufacturing swimming pool related products. He then taught SEVY how to work with PVC.\r\n\r\nOne of the first PVC products SEVY produced was inflatable bathtub called Dou Dou. It was an instant hit in postwar France--mothers could bathe their children even where no facilities were available. The media hailed Dou Dou as a significant invention. Soon, SEVY added small pools and flotation devices such as rings, beach balls, and inflatable swim jackets to its product line. Safe, hygienic products, made of PVC and designed for portability, durability and convenience, became the SEVY trademark.\r\n\r\nThe company quickly outgrew its small facilities in Vitry. Mr. Grimbert accepted an attractive offer from the French government to take over a defunct textile factor in the tiny Alsatian village of Buhl. After establishing its new headquarters, the company added the letters \"lor\" to its name, and became Sevylor. In French, l'or means gold. By coincidence, or possibly fate, Sevylor has proven to be \"as good as gold\" to its owners, retailers, consumers, and employees.\r\n\r\nProduct Description\r\nThe Rio has a raised bow and stern and is as close in shape, comfort and styling to the traditional North American Indian canoe as an inflatable boat will ever get. It's double hull construction makes it very rugged and rigid.

            "description": "Stand-Up Paddle Boarding or SUP is a new fashionable sport developed in Hawaii. It is gaining tremendous popularity among surfers who find it as an excellent way to train while the surf is down. Paddle Boarding is an increasingly popular sport activity that involves paddling and/or surfing. It is as close as you can get to \"walking on water.\" The standup board is relatively easy to ride and allows paddlers of all skill levels, including beginners, to enjoy a stable, comfortable ride while getting a moderate workout. Stand-Up Paddle Boarding can be done in the ocean, harbors, rivers and lakes. However, some practice is needed, same as with bicycle or roller-skates first time use, and you can't expect to jump on this board and start doing some fancy tricks. Stand up paddle board video instructions can be found here. Also, please visit our FAQ section to read more about how to properly operate air valve. An inflatable stand-up paddle board can be inflated to almost 10 psi air pressure for an excellent performance on the water. We are highly recommend our new 12V electric high-pressure pump that can inflate paddle board to full working pressure in under 2 minutes. No hand pump is needed, and intelligent circuitry of electric pump will shut down pump automatically once board is fully inflated. Our new and upgraded SATURN inflatable multi-sport boards 11' SOT330 and 12' SOT365 have D-rings in the front and back for attachment of a surfboard safety leash or carry handles, and set of D-rings at edges of the board for the attachment of an optional kayak seats, to use this board as a sit-on-top surf kayak. Remove the seat - and you have a SUP paddle board or long surfboard. Install kayak seats and you have a sit-on-top kayak for 1-2 persons that is fast and easy to paddle! SOT boards are not only great as surf kayaks, but also excellent for long trips to remote locations on a warm day."

            "description": "The best thing about these diamond earrings is that they can be worn every single day to show them off. Flirty and eye-catching, each round-cut stone rests in a four-prong setting made of 18 karat white gold. The diamonds have a total carat weight of 3/4 carat. The smooth finish of the metal and the light-reflecting cut of the gems make the pair immediately noticeable. Posts with friction backs keep the shiny pair securely on the ears. This is an essential accessory that can be worn frequently and with almost anything--it is certain to be a favorite.\r\nThese are fine quality diamonds, with exceptional brilliance. They are near-colorless, with a minimum color rating of H-I, and appear white to the eye. The clarity rating of these diamonds is SI1/2, meaning there are small inclusions that can be seen somewhat easily under 10x magnification. These inclusions are not visible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nAbout Diamonds\r\nDiamond Clarity:  \r\nNo two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare."

The wok measures 14 inches in diameter (17 inches with handles), and 4 inches deep--generous enough for a family-size meal.\r\nThe wok must be seasoned before first use to create a nonstick patina that also helps prevent rusting. After washing, apply a thin layer of vegetable oil and heat the wok for one hour. While the wok can be seasoned on a grill, an oven works best. Instructions for the seasoning process are included with the wok. After subsequent use, the wok should be washed by hand and dried before storing.

It breeds in forest (especially varzea, but also in open sections of Terra Firme) and woodland of tropical South America from Trinidad and Venezuela south to Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It extends slightly into Central America, where it is restricted to Panama. It is an endangered species in Trinidad, and is on the verge of being extirpated from Paraguay, but still remains widespread and fairly common in a large part of mainland South America. There is also a breeding population in Miami-Dade County, USA.[1] It is therefore listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International."

Until you learn his/her language, and he/she learns yours, keep putting supplies like food or toys in front of him/her until he/she calms down. The best food for monkeys are exactly what you eat. Fruits, vegetables, pasta, breads and rice. Do not feed them chocolate, avocado or other pet foods. Begin training the monkey. Say his/her name often when feeding, or offering him/her a toy. Also, say his/her name when petting and loving him/her. When he/she responds to his/her name, give him/her a treat and praise him/her. When saying a command, act out how you want the monkey to act! So if you say \"dance,\" start hopping around! When he/she learns a trick, give him/her treats and praise him/her! Start with simple commands like \"sit\" and \"stay\". Generally, monkeys are not \"tricksters\". Sit would be a good command, but getting a monkey to stay in one place for more than a few seconds would be quite a feat.

The Quantum Infrared cooking system completely climates flare ups and its design allows for perhaps the greatest grilling versatility seen in years. Each burner has its own temperature gauge located above the control knob and working at grate level for a true reading of the heat about to sear your steak or whatever you may be grilling. The Quantum Infrared design also allows you to add wood chips directly on to the cooking grates for added flavor and no flare up. This 2 burner grill is highly efficient due to the unique patented infrared grates and thus needs just 2 burners get the job done with the smaller cooking area. The Quantum Infrared Urban is ideal for a wide range of cooking temperatures. Perhaps space is an issue for your patio or perhaps you just want high-end infrared cooking performance without the 500+ price tag. This grill features 340 Square Inch of primary cooking area, 125 Square Inch of secondary cooking area, new \"Surefire\" electronic ignition, and a combination of stainless steel and painted steel appliance style cart construction with folding side shelves. As with all grills, we recommend keeping the firebox clean to help avoid flare up as well as using a grill cover to protect your investment."

In a group of two to six players, you'll draw an identity card for an animal, food, or common object but with one catch--everyone but you will see the card, displayed by the headband on your forehead. The goal is to deduce who or what you are by asking the players questions before the clock runs out."

With Fushigi the operator exploits the reflective properties of a sphere through specific hand and body isolations and movements that are designed to give the appearance that the Fushigi sphere is moving on its own or even floating. Using Fushigi is an incredible, therapeutic form of relaxation. The art of maneuvering a reflective sphere through mind and body isolation and manipulation creates the illusion that the sphere may be defying the laws of gravity, as if the sphere is moving on its own."

This reviewer has found them to be excellent tools for teaching foreign languages--children will comfortably experiment when manipulating a puppet, but not when simply talking to a friend. As children mature, they are able to use puppets in a more sophisticated manner that will help them last a good long time.\r\nSnowy Owl is well made and true to form with her white and gray spotted fur. The texture of her leather beak and talons gives her an air of authenticity, and her large glass eyes ringed with thick white fur won't miss a rodent. A plastic stick inside Snowy Owl's body lets you rotate her head 360 degrees. With a wingspan of 22 inches, she will play a prominent role on the puppet stage. --Sandy Hirsch"

Targets are ejected from the \"trap\" at pre-determined intervals--one every two to one every ten seconds--reaching a height of 7' that allows for indoor use. When hit by the gun's infrared beam, the plastic targets \"break\" apart into two pieces to reward an accurate shot. Shorter intervals require faster \"reloading\" by pumping the gun, which responds with a realistic loading sound between each shot. Targets are snapped back together for immediate replay. Trap requires four C batteries; gun requires three AAA batteries. Ages 10 and up. Trap 14 1/2\" "

            "description": "Track rider is NEW, NEVER USED and in it original packaging. \r\n\r\nThis track rider sustained slight coloration damage during shipping to our warehouse.  Front right corner (when looking at the engine from the front) was slightly pressed at some time during shipping, slightly discoloring the plastic in that corner. The corner is not pushed in, but coloration indicates that it must have been bumped / pressed during shipping.  This in no way affects the operation of the unit. This unit also has some small white marks on the left side of the bumper also. Only the red plastic bumper on the front of the unit is slightly discolored white. We have attached pictures (discoloration is \"whiter\" in real life vs. the picture, but this is the best photo we could get - click on the photo to enlarge it). Arrows are pointed in pictures to show slightly discolored areas. These small discolorations can save you money as we have discounted the price."

The versatile unit functions as a grill, griddle, and panini maker thanks to its three cooking positions--fixed, float, or open flat--and three removable plates, which consist of an upper grill plate, a lower grill plate, and a lower griddle plate. As an open griddle, the appliance can cook up eggs, pancakes, and hash browns; insert the grill plates for cooking bacon, hamburgers, or fresh summer vegetables. Its floating hinge system automatically adjusts to the thickness of food for perfectly grilled panini sandwiches or thick steaks. The grill plates come with a ribbed design that helps grease drain away from food for healthier results, and all the plates provide a nonstick coating to ensure effortless food release and quick cleanup by hand or in the dishwasher. Other highlights include adjustable heat up to 450 degrees F, a lockable upper plate for heat without touching the food, a 30-minute timer, a power-on indicator and ready light, a removable drip drawer, and a storage drawer for holding an unused grill plate. Instructions and a dual-sided cleaning scraper come included. With its attractive chrome-plated housing, the 1500-watt UL-listed grill and panini maker measures approximately 13-3/4 by 13-1/2 by 7 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty."

And then there's the CBR's awe-inspiring degree of Honda technology: tuned twin-spar frame, Programmed fuel injection, the Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) and Honda's available Combined ABS that all add up to put the CBR600RR way ahead of anything in the 600 class.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, one thing stands out above all the rest: The CBR600RR is just a blast to ride.

            "description": " Do not accept cheap imitations! www.greenplanetarmor.com has our years of research! You may be exposing yourself to more stress than you thought by simply using your Cell Phone, PDA or Bluetooth headset, etc. Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted from these devices has been linked to various stress-induced problems and illnesses and could be compromising your health and well being. Our Cell Chip combines the benefits of two powerful, innovative and scientifically substantiated technologies: the proprietary, patented noise field nano-technology MRET (Molecular Resonance Effect Technology), and the proprietary subtle energy innovation ERT (Energy Resonance Technology). These cutting-edge technologies offer a groundbreaking and effective way to deal with the cumulative stress associated with living in today's electronic environment. Our technology was developed through years of research under Dr. Igor Smirnoff, the same researcher who studied the effects of the Chernobyl Disaster. He found that a certain portion of the population did not suffer the grave illness that most of the population did. Dr. Smirnoff found the common link between the healthy population, was able to create a polymer based on the common elemental compounds. This polymer reacts by oscillating when it comes in contact with a certain frequency range, the same frequency given off by cell phones and other electronic devices. These are the same frequencies that research has linked to causing tumors as result of long-term exposure. Green Planet Armor doesn't block the harmful radiation, because that would block the usefulness of electronic devices. The key to the technology is that the polymer acts as a cloaking device. It doesn't change the radiation, it changes how your body perceives and reacts to the radiation. Instead of detecting something harmful, the body detects something harmless and doesn't react. greenplanetarmor.com"

There are five settings for coffee strength--extra-mild, mild, regular, strong, and extra-strong. Plus, three buttons allow for easily choosing the cup size--ristretto (small), espresso (medium), and large (American coffee).\r\nThe espresso machine also offers a unique beans-to-brew system that includes an integrated conical burr grinder with adjustable fineness settings that automatically grinds coffee beans right before brewing for exceptionally aromatic espresso. In addition, the unit comes equipped with a patented single-touch cappuccino/latte system, which includes a 25-ounce milk container and two detachable lids, one for frothed milk for cappuccinos and the other for steamed milk for lattes. Place the cup under the nozzle and press the button for a perfect cappuccino or latte every time. The amounts of frothed/steamed milk and coffee are adjustable, and the entire container is detachable, so it can easily be placed in the refrigerator. A unique automatic cleaning function operates with the push of a button, and dishwasher-safe parts provide quick tidying up."

This sport design is even more lightweight, and it adds the durability of sweat resistance and the convenience of interchangeable lenses. THUMP PRO launches a new era in sport training.\r\nCoaches and trainers know that athletes have one-track minds - at any given moment, the human brain is focused on a single thing. Divert attention from the burn of exertion and your training will find a whole new level. That's why we invented THUMP PRO, digital music eyewear in a sport design that fuels your training session with the music that moves you. Whether you're running, biking or pushing your potential with any kind of workout, THUMP PRO sunglasses will help you find your limits and just as easily ignore them. Athletes have endured the \"ball and chain\" of portable players for a quarter of a century. Cords dangle. Wires tangle. The base unit knocks around. The speakers jam into the ears and completely block out the environment with an all-or-nothing design. Oakley solved all these problems.\r\nNOTE: All Items are Factory Sealed!

            "description": "A table fan that quietly and effectively cools an entire room without any blades? Introducing the GSI Air Multiplier, which works differently from conventional fans. The Air Multiplier uses an airfoil-shaped ramp to amplify the airflow 15 to 18 times to create a cool blast of smooth air without the unpleasant buffeting caused by spinning blades. The energy-efficient motor draws in more than 5 gallons of air per second using the same technologies used in jet engines. The air passes over the airfoil-shaped ramp, which channels its direction. Air behind and around the machine is also drawn into the airflow, amplifying it at least 15 times for a quiet, cool breeze that will let you relax. With no blades or grille to get in the way, the Air Multiplier is safe around kids and pets, and it's easy to clean too. The touch-tilt feature pivots on its own center of gravity, letting it stay put without clamping."

            "description": "Sanyo's new Air Washer air purification system suppresses airborne bacteria and germs utilizing an exclusive electrolyzed water technology, removes dust and allergens, reduces pollen and neutralizes odors. Sanyo's electrolyzed water technology has been tested and proven effective in suppressing airborne germs, bacteria, odors, allergens and mold through third party certification institutions including RTI. In addition, electrolyzed water has proven effective in significantly reducing the level of viable airborne germs and bacteria, according to an independent research institution in the United States. Simply add tap water to the water container and the chlorine ions in the tap water are molecularly split through an electrolysis process in the unit into electrolyzed water. The electrolyzed water attacks the protein spikes in bacteria and inactivates the spikes so they are unable to attach to human cells. The units' 3 directional (upward, leftward, rightward stream) airflow emits the purified air and extremely fine electrolyzed water mist to quickly clean the air throughout the room. A High Performance 4-stage HEPA filter removes 99.97% of airborne particles and allergens, reduces airborne pollens with allergy blocking filter and fights common odors including pet dander and tobacco smoke. The sleek design is simple to operate, has an automatic timer function and filter replacement indicator."
